The seats could be softer, but more importantly would be ventilation.  I am extremely disgusted with the fact that Toyota thinks they can pressure buyers to go for their land barge Avalon just to get fans in the seats.  Honestly, this one looks better and drives better in my opinion.  The audio is very good.  It blows Honda out of the water when it comes to audio performance.  Crystal clear audio is important to me in addition to sounding full across the acoustic range.  My last complaint is interior rattles in the dash.  WTF?  I cannot figure it out, but it annoys me.

I don't know about 5 series since I haven't driven one. But I drove a 2018 BMW 330i for 5 hours straight, and got into the 2018 Camry XLE V6 right away (not even the XSE). 

From what I feel: the 330i is faster from a red light. Once the Camry revs past 4000rpm, it is significantly more powerful. Near sea level, there's no doubt that the new Camry V6 will eat the 330 alive. 

Besides, the Camry's steering wheel gives more feedback. (Yes you see it right. Camry.) 

I know comparing comfort levels between a Camry and a 330i is not fair. The Camry is bigger, and has more premium feel.

In terms of reliability... let's see after 20 years. Camry is THE taxi car in Edmonton. It handles snow and ice really well, and it last forever. (Well, who doesn't know this fact anyway.) 1 million km no problem.

Side note: I used to REALLY hate Japanese cars, ESPECIALLY Toyota, since they have a reputation of breaking up in accidents. However, after driving one, all I can say is that this Carmy is rock solid. IIHS crash test numbers don't lie. The roof strength of this Camry is actually stronger than BMW 330 and RAM 1500 pickup truck. 

Oh, and it feels like planted to the ground even at 200km/h. I'm not telling you how I found out about this, but you can drive one in a safe environment to confirm.

Some people may claim that this is not a fair comparison, since Camry is a mid-size and 330 is a compact. However, what I see is the Camry V6 is faster, more comfortable, more reliable, cheaper to buy, cheaper to maintain, and better looking (XSE model black on white). What makes people choose the BMW anyway? The badge.

The buttons look cheap, and the red vinyl looks cheap up close. The shifter boot looked cracked already and the door sounded weak. The push to start button looks cheap too. I like the design of the interior though, but they could have implemented it better.

Oh and the beige roof liner with the black door trim and red seats is too much for me. If the roof liner was black so there was a more complete black and red look, it would look better to me.

That said, I prefer the old gated shifter. It was nice to know by feel where the gear stick is at, even if it is an auto. It also avoids putting the gear on the wrong selection by pulling too far or pushing too far. The gated shifter used to be a premium option you only get on higher-end vehicles, feels like a mistake getting rid of it.

UgifKxfLBCkm-XgCoAEC,Chris McDevitt,1 year ago,1524058498394,"I watch most of your reviews and you normally are pretty spot on. However your bias with this review is pretty apparent. I would not use the phrase ""a little more power"" to describe about an 100 lb-ft difference between this trim Camry and the Fusion Sport. Also this V6 engine is comparable in power to the optional 2.0 four banger in the Fusion as well. You appeared to also be more willing to give Toyota the ""benefit of the doubt."" For example, with the cheap sounding door closure noise. Perhaps it is a pre-production model, but I have not noticed you being so quick to jump that assumption with other manufactures. You said that Toyota ""Really caught up with their competitors"" in regards to technology. I would really not agree with that statement, considering the lack of Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, a navigation map from what appears like 2007, cooled seats, optional AWD, and even the memory seating! Toyota is still lagging behind many of their competitors in regards to technology options. I am not saying that this was a bad video by any means! I enjoyed it and Toyota clearly is attempting to improve the Camry. I would just try and be more mindful about your personal bias as a Auto Journalist. As consumers we are depending on you to provide accurate information with as little spin as possible. Thanks for all of the quality content and I look forward to seeing your next video!",0,true,2,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,UgifKxfLBCkm-XgCoAEC.8UJSreYUiWk8UNLcxBtR4S,Redline Reviews,1 year ago,1524058498615,"The current Fusion 2.0T makes 240 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque. The Camry's V6 makes 301 hp and 267 lb-ft of torque. While torque figures are pretty similar, the extra hp and sound of the V6 makes a huge difference and the Toyota has 2 more gears to choose from in the transmission. When comparing the Fusion Sport, the power from the twin-turbo V6 is easily apparent, but you have to keep in mind, that trim weighs over 4,000 pounds which is 400 more than the Camry. The 6-speed automatic is also not as quick and responsive as the 8-speed in the Toyota. We'd have to line the two cars side by side and do a race and while we're confident the Fusion Sport would most likely win, nobody buys a family sedan to go drag racing. It's really about the whole package that consumers look for. We like the Ford's AWD system and extra power, but the interior of the new Camry is far nicer than the Fusion's. Simply in the design and materials, the Fusion is just getting old, Ford is working on a replacement soon. Regarding the door sound, we like to give any manufacture the benefit of the doubt, fact is, if we were at a Ford or Hyundai event reviewing an ""early production"" model, we would have said the same thing. We acknowledged several times that Toyota has simply caught up to their competitors in the technology department and still have some work to do, but you have to drive the new Camry to really see how much they've improved it over the old one. No, its not perfect, but no car is. Calling us biased is pretty unfair, we gave the Camry a very fair review and know the competition in the segment very well.",1

I appreciate that you went through the effort to not only disagree with me, but also inform as well. I was unaware of the 400 pound weight difference. I bet that and 2 extra gears does make quite the difference driving! I agree that the Fusion is old today and needs updating. I only brought up the Fusion Sport because that is the vehicle you yourself used as a comparison with engine power. I am looking forward to seeing and driving the new Camry. It is clear from your video that they have made massive strives with improving the Camry. I apologize if you or anyone else took this as a personal attack. Going back 3 days later, I can see how my first reply could have been interpreted harshly.

But you shouldn't omit important information when you do these videos, people do watch and listen. You said that the new V6 Camry is class leading in power with the exception of the Fusion Sport. While technically that is true, the Chevrolet Impala and Buick Lacrosse both make slightly more power and at least in the case of the Impala, it cost just a couple thousand more in your American dollars than the Camry, and several thousand less than the Toyota full-sized offering: the Avalon. Therefore, people might be inclined to cross shop these cars, and in that regard, it might be better value for someone looking at a Camry to consider putting out a little more money (depending on trim levels, maybe even save a little money) and get a full-sized Chevrolet Impala rather than a mid-sized Camry, and get a modest amount more power too.

UghMjdDBgbI9IXgCoAEC,Nissan Skyline,1 year ago,1524058504792,"Overall great review on the Camry. +1. But I just have one thing I disagree with. When you said the ""enthusiast"" will purchase the XSE, I disagree with this. To be real with you - no enthusiast will buy a Camry. (I'm not talking in terms of them buying it as a daily driver.) The enthusiast will buy the 86. The Camry and the other cars in its segment are amazing family cars. Best in this world at what they do. However, they are just not enthusiast cars. Furthermore, I respect Toyota for making the Camry look less boring, but I think they did a tad too much. They should have made it look less boring but don't make it a sporty design. Making a Camry sporty makes it tacky as fuck. A Camry should never and will never be sporty car. The back of the XSE looks like a ""riced"" out Camry as well. Think about - a quad-exhaust set-up on a Camry? Why do you need quad-exhaust set-up on a heavy car that only makes 301HP and probably 250WHP? The fuck? Hence - tacky. 

In my opinion - they should have just toned down the sporty/sharp line design on the exterior and interior while maintaining those nice LED lights. Also lose that stupid quad-exhaust system. That would be perfect for a Camry.",2,true,2,,,,,,

Ugi7sk8F8NrSwngCoAEC,Danny Murphy,1 year ago,1524058511141,"Numb steering in a mass produced full sized sedan is gonna prevent people from pushing these cars past their limit on public roads. Large FWD cars abruptly change their driving characteristics at very high speeds, contrary to Hot Hatchbacks, which are revered for their low speed adjustability and connected driving experience. Anyway, as pertinent as that may be for an enthusiast, for others - men, mostly between 16 and 26 - that sudden change is usually the event that causes serious accidents. So to conclude that theory I will be so bold in stating that a lack of steering feel will actually PREVENT accidents; As crazy as that sounds. I believe that Toyota knows this and since that developmental omission saves them money, they leave it alone! If you disagree at least do me one courtesy by asking yourself this: Which vehicles encourage you to drive faster: The vehicle with communicative steering that tells you what the wheels are doing more and more the harder you push it, or the car with numb, yet accurate steering no matter what speed you go? This car appeals to younger buyers without kids, contrary to what was the case before. It doesn't take a genius to know that this is mainly due to the recent boom of crossovers in every manufacturer's lineup. This theory makes me wonder if Toyota will end up increasing the amount of V6 XSE models they produce, or will the spice they added to the 4 cylinder models be enough to satiate this demographics desire for practical, affordable performance? The Camry has evolved, so has the automotive industry. The run of the mill Camry buyer will be a millennial who grew up driving mom and dad's Camry to and from their high school. Yea it was bland but it went from A to B and had enough space for 4 other students and all their stuff, the only envy they had was for the motocross/X games type of kid who somehow got his hands on something fast and shouty i.e. wrx, mustang gt, 330i bmw, 350z etc. This envy isn't all consuming but it creates a mental note to buy something sporty after college once the money starts coming in but before they settle down with a significant other and eventually have kids.

If you've driven the 2015-2017 XSE V6 what would you say are the major differences in terms of performance and handling between that and equivalent 2018 model? My current daily driver is a 2016 XSE V6 and I find it to be a reasonably decent performer for a 3,400 pound front drive sedan. I'm just wondering whether the 2018 is similar, a small cut above, or a huge improvement in terms of performance and handling. You said 0-60 felt similar though I'm curious about the responsiveness of the new engine and transmission combo as well as the handling when comparing XSE trim against XSE trim between the new and the outgoing model.",0,false,0,,,,,,

But if you want to compare, lets compare. To based a ""sports sedan"" from the lack of HP is pure stupidity. HP is not what makes the car have fast acceleration. That's torque. This is where you fail to understand cars because you are a raging idiot. The Acura TLX (AWD) is able to put down more WTQ than that fucking stupid Camry. Did you take into count Acura's amazing AWD system? Wider tires? More grip? Lower stance? What about the TLX's aggressive gearing ratio? Do you understand what all this means? Clearly you fucking don't when you are out here spilling out bullshit about how the TLX lacks power. The TLX lacks power compared to something like an Infiniti Q50 3.0T, not a fucking Camry. 

Google the fucking numbers. The Acura TLX hits 60 from knot at 5.5 seconds. Your ricer quad-exhaust 2018 Camry XSE does it in 5.8 seconds. How is it possible the Acura TLX is still faster with less HP and have the same torque as the Camry? The better gearing transmission, the AWD, and wider tires with more grip.

Not only you fail to understand cars, you fail to understand the simple concept of googling. The 2017 Toyota Camry XSE V6 does 0-60 in 6.1 seconds and finishes the 1/4 mile at 14.5 seconds. Learn to Google. I have every right to call you a retard if you compare a daily driving family sedan to an entry-level sports sedan. Its like comparing apple to oranges. There is a reason why people don't compare the BMW M4 to the Honda Accord Coupe. You need to compare within segments because that's where most people are likely to be cross-buyers, you fucking retard. No one jumps from a Camry XSE to an Acura TLX. 

""That ricer you are talking has great handling, power, and wider wheels too."" 
Great handling? From a mid-size family car with soft suspensions and high stance height. Okay retard. Power? 301HP to the front wheels in a mid-size family cars with no aggressive gearing? Okay retard. Wider wheels? A Camry with wide wheels? If you say so, retard. 

""Plus, the quad exhaust openings to increase horsepower and torque"" - Your quote. I just rekt you in another post explaining to you why this is wrong. Please stop drinking Windex because its make you more retarded. MORE EXHAUST OPENINGS DOES NOT EQUAL MORE HP/TQ. ITS THE PIPE THAT MATTERS. The Camry XSE could have gotten the same 301HP from a dual exhaust set-up. Hence, the quad-exhaust is fucking ricer. 

You do know that .3 seconds faster is considered quite a lot of time in terms of racing? By your logic, that means the Camry is only .6 seconds slower than the Infiniti G/Infiniti Q50, which means the G/Q50 is slow in your eyes? In racing, even .1 second is a lot of fucking time, you fucking retard.

Clearly Toyota has made a much better car than their previous models, that's why people are comparing it to cars outside of its class. 

But if we are looking only at car specifications, the 2018 Camry XSE V6 is indeed comparable to the Acura TLX. I don't care how much you think the Camry is a ""family car"" or whatever but its specs speak for themselves.

The 2017 TLX has 290 hp and 267 lbft of torque. The Camry has 301 hp and 267 lbft of torque. You say that the TLX has wider tires but it doesn't. It uses a 225/50R18 while the Camry uses a 235/40R19...clearly Camry has a wider tire. The 2017 TLX has an estimated 0-60 of 5.7 sec, the Camry has an estimated 0-60 of 5.5 sec.   

Point is sure the older Camry models would not have been comparable to the TLX but the 2018 one is. All you can do is take your hat off to Toyota and be glad they moved the midsize ""family car"" forward.

If I wanted a POS with plastic wood, mechanical issues, cheap cabin materials and ugly styling that's too little too late, I would have bought an Acura instead of a Lexus. They've demoted themselves in the eyes of the luxury vehicle market from a luxury car to a premium regular car.

At this point, Buick vehicles feel more luxurious than Acura vehicles these days, and are actually more fun to drive. Honda/ Acura really fell from grace since the 90's. They used to make cars that felt special like the Legend and the Integra Type R & the original NSX, and now they make lifeless vehicles that handle like garbage, are universally panned for their styling and build quality, and the tanking sales figures reflect that. It's a shame too, because I love what Acura used to be and I'm really rooting for them to give me a car I can spend money on without regretting immediately afterwards. 

The bottom line is that this Camry XSE is now cross shopped with Maxima's and Acura TLX's according to dealership figures, no one cross shops the TLX with German or Japanese luxury cars.

Just because I defend Acura does not mean I think they are the best fucking shit right now. In fact, I think, as of 2017, their vehicles are garbage American made junk. However, this does not change the fact that the Acura TLX is better than a Toyota Camry XSE. The materials, the quietness, the smoothness and in just about every department the Acura TLX is better. If you think otherwise, you have an IQ in the negative.

Do you know why Acura is cross-shopped between the Maxima/Camry XSE? Its not because they are similar but because the Maxima/Camry XSE is priced fairly close to a entry level TLX. People that want to upgrade from their family sedans but can't afford something like a Lexus or BMW goes towards Acura. Acura has always been the ""affordable"" luxury brand. 

The fact that put Buick in the same sentence as Acura makes you an idiot. Buick is trash and a poor investment. A fucking ILX is better than a Buick and the fucking ILX is a joke of a car. 

No, sorry to you. Sorry you would rather have a Camry XSE, Maxima, or Buick over an Acura TLX. I'm sorry you were dropped on the head. Acura might not make great cars like they did in the 90s and 00s, but their cars are still better than the Camry XSE, Maxima and Buick. 

Plastic wood? You mean like every car company that uses plastic wood in the entry level segment? Hell. You can get faux leather from BMW still. 
Mechanical issues? You think Honda/Acura cars have mechanical issues but a Buick don't? One word: retarded.
Cheap cabin materials? You said Acura has cheap cabin materials but praise the Camry, Maxima and Buick? Acura materials are 100% better than the new Camry XSE. This is why I stated the Acura is still better than the Camry XSE. The Camry XSE still feels fucking like a standard family sedan. 
Ugly styling? Sure. I'll give that to you. Its ugly now. But every other point you made is wrong. 

Get it through your thick fucking head folks, I'm not defending Acura as a good car company. I'm saying the Acura TLX is better than a Toyota Camry XSE.",1

If anything it makes them weaker. Calling the car a ""stupid fucking Camry"" clearly shows your bias and dislike towards Camry's. 

First of all have you ever extensively driven the new camry? You say the TLX is smoother, quieter, etc, do you have proof of this? The TLX uses better materials, ok how do you know what materials the new camry uses? The TLX puts down more WTQ, sure where did you find the Camry's wheel torque? Have you seen the new Camry's gear ratios? Look it up, it'll surprise you. The camry actually uses wider tires, has more hp, and has similar torque. 

Yes the TLX has a better interior, no debate there. Look I'm not trying to say the Camry is some godly car that's better than the TLX but you're making so many conparisons especially about the performance of the cars that simply cannot be answered/just assuming the Camry is worse. I agree that the older generation Camry's indeed were worse in all those categories you just mentioned but this one is supposedly improved in all those categories. Car technology has to improve as time goes on. Toyota clearly made a big improvement and as a result has made some even recent higher level cars look comparable like the Maxima, the TLX, and the Lexus ES350. This camry that toyota has created will make those cars better in the future.

So why don't you wait and see what people really say about this car when it's out of the factory or go and drive one yourself first instead of just assuming it's worse than the TLX. If you're thinking ""dude you're a fucking moron, I don't need to wait and see or look up the specs of the new Camry, I just know the TLX is better regardless of what the Camry's specs are"", which is the vibe you seem to be giving in all of you're comments then you're the dumb one.",5

You idiots were just triggered that I said its not better than actual luxury or sports car. You people are trying to put the Camry in a position its not suppose to be in.

First off; the new Camrys are already available in my area as rental cars. Second; I already rented one. Third; it drives like any old standard Camry but more modern. Fourth; Acura TLX is much smoother and quieter because it has more sound proofing. Fifth; besides from driving the cars - look at the fucking pictures. The Camry just looks more cheap than the Acura. You blind or what? Sixth; have heard of Google? Google the engine specs for both cars. Its already online. You act like the car isn't on the market yet. 

No. But you are making out the Camry to be a godly car, just like the rest of you freaks. I said the Camry was a good car - a good family car. But I also said the Camry is not a Luxury or Sports, then you fucking retards send me multiple notifications insulting me. Now you want to play victim? Please fuck off. 

Obviously. Toyota made improvements to their Camry. Each year, cars get newer. The problem is not that. The problem is you idiots actually think, actually fucking think, a Camry is on par with the Acura TLX. And you just added a new one. You think the Camry is similar to the Lexus ES350. The only thing they have in common is a shared platform. If Toyota was in the business of making money, they wouldn't make the Camry as good as a Lexus ES350. 

The fuck? You do know that Toyota does not draw technology from a Camry to improve their other cars, right? That's the opposite of what car companies do. Audi drew tech from the Audi R8. Lexus drew tech from the Lexus LFA. Its trickle down from the top, not the other way around. You clearly are a fucking moron.

By the fucking retards here and your logic, the Toyota Camry is also better than the Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS, TLX, A3, A4, and etc... too right?

Now I indeed can read, but thanks for checking, and in this comment thread you never once said that Camry was a ""good family car"", you might've been thinking that but you've called it a ""standard family car"" or a ""stupid fucking Camry"" so many times that it doesn't even matter if you think it's a good family car because clearly you think it's a ""stupid fucking"" car.  

If you drove the car, then you didn't drive it hard enough to make any fair comparison. You couldn't feel the double wishbone suspension when you went over a bump? Look up any driving review on Youtube or anywhere and it'll tell you it drives MUCH better. I own a 2014 Camry and I've driven the 2018 one multiple times and if you can't feel the difference then I'm not sure what to say. Try blasting it through a backroad and you'll be pleasantly surprised trust me. 

I have used Google. Send me a link of something that shows me all those things you are saying about the Acura TLX is better compared to the Camry's stuff. Look I'm not saying the Camry is better, I'm simply saying they've made a better car than before that makes it comparable not better, but comparable to cars in a higher class.  

How am I making out the Camry to be some godly car? How? Sure the new model will likely top its class in every aspect but how am I saying it is godly? Because it's comparable to the TLX? 

The 2017 Lexus ES350 uses the exact same engine on the 2017 Camry V6 . Now that they've upgraded the 2018 Camry's engine I think it's fair to say it uses a better and more efficient engine than the 2017 ES350. I'm not talking about interior quality or overall quality of car. One's a luxury, one's a family sedan. Obviously the luxury car is going to be higher quality than the midsize sedan. But car performance? Tires? Gear ratios? HP and TQ? Camry clearly upped its quality in terms of those things and that is what makes it more comparable to those cars, not the premium quality of the luxury cars. Those cars are >5k more expensive. Obviously the more expensive car is going to be more premium. 

Bro, I'm saying when technology advances forward, it compels other car companies to speed up their rate of technology improvement as well. You're telling me that if Lexus somehow made a super affordable luxurious car that had 500 hp, 500 ftlb tq, and 60 mpg, other companies wouldn't notice? LIke you said, they are in the business of making money. When one company does better, they will all do better in the long run or they'll be unable to compete and lose sales. 

No, I'm not saying the Camry is better than those cars you listed. I'm simply saying Toyota did a good job with this new Camry and has made it COMPARABLE to those cars NOT better in terms of car performance not premium quality of car. Like I said before just chillout man. We can debate cars all day, I like it, but don't be throwing meaningless insults at other people if they have a different opinion. Kids do that.",4

You are merely just a result of backfire from other comments. You want to have a civil conversation. Lets have one.

Better than the old Camrys? Yes. Still feels like a Camry? Yes. My rental was not a XSE model because those don't exist as rentals. Second; I would not take a 301HP FWD car to the mountains. That's insane. 

There is no Google article quoting the Acura TLX is better than the Camry. There isn't even an article comparing those two cars. I was talking about the articles for the specs. 

No. You are making it sound godly by comparing it to the TLX and ES350. Godly might be exaggerated but better would be the right word. They are all in different segments. By doing this you are pushing the Camry into a segment it does not belong in. That's my problem. That was always the problem. I never said the Camry was a bad car. Would you compare a Infiniti Q50 to a M3? No. Same thing here. You wouldn't compare a Camry to a ES350/TLX. Just simple.

Here's the problem again, in my opinion. You implying the Camry is a performance car while its not. Its clearly faster. The Camry XSE is the top-end Camry, which is a family sedan still. The Lexus ES350 is a luxury family sedan. The fact that we are comparing it, is the problem.  Lexus never made the ES350 to be fast. They made it as a luxury version of the Camry. You can barely compare these two cars because the ES350 might be slower but its better than the Camry in every other way. And I personally think the ES350 is one of Lexus' worst cars within its portfolio. Its under-sold and not in high demand.  

I know that's what you are saying but it does not apply when its within the same car company. That's what I was trying to say. Lexus trickle down their products to Toyota. Acura to Honda. Infiniti to Nissan. Its not the other way around. If you were just talking about in a general context versus other cars within the same segment, then that's true. But if you were saying Toyota is gonna give Camry all the luxurious stuff before Lexus, that is false.

The thing with the comparable part - this is what gets me. Answer this: if the Camry XSE is comparable and better than TLX, Q50 and IS200T, then why buy those cars at all? I had people say the new Camry XSE is better than the IS200T/IS300 because its better performing and has more tech. By this fact, the Nissan Maxima would better than the Infiniti Q50 too. But the thing is, as good as the new Camry is - they are not better than these cars. If they were, these car companies pretty just shot themselves in the foot.",1

,,,,,,,,UggWuLtBouFdTHgCoAEC.8U4DXRUCFuc8WpM6vJSIlf,Trades46,1 year ago,1524058521620,"I'll enlighten you one last time. Acura is ""supposed"" to carry the luxury game to competitors like Infiniti & Lexus against mainstay rivals like BMW, Audi & Mercedes. However they aren't doing that good of a job at that. Honda has definitely cheapened out on building a proper RWD architecture to make their 'sport sedan' which Nissan & Toyota did not, meaning the Q50 & IS both just shit all over the TLX. Even SH-AWD can only help alleviate the problem, but dynamically it is NOT REMOTELY a sport sedan in the same category. 

Now for my OP (the Camry XSE V6 making the TLX obsolete), for 2018 Acura tried to narrow the gap with the A-spec which gives stiffer springs, sportier bodywork & larger wheels & tires (19"" and 235 section tires) to compete better, but the problem I have is the powertrain is largely noncompetitive; 290hp is nowhere near the IS350 306hp muchless the Q50 new 400hp motor. 

The ZF 9spd in the TLX is still that terrible transaxle which Chrysler and Honda continues to have headaches over bad reliability, jerky operation & confusing shift logic. So bad in fact Honda has chosen to DISCONTINUE the ZF 9spd (in only 2 short years) in favor of their own in-house 10spd automatic which is found in the new 2018 Odyssey & upcoming 2018 Accord, and will likely replace Acura's maligned 9spd after production ramps up in 2018. 

These reasons combined This is where my argument of the Camry XSE being a better car than the TLX stems from. The Camry has moved from being ""another office lady's car"" to the top of the midsize segment with this 2018 redesign. You may have had a 2018 rental but that is meaningless as the model I compare the TLX to is the XSE which features many luxury car features most upscale brands will ask for extra $ on the options sheet & is the best tuned in chassis, suspension & powertrains of the 2018 Camrys. Add to that the transverse-engine FWD derived nature of the TLX, its mediocre powertrain, plastics heavy interior & convoluted two-screen infotainment (Infiniti Q50 is SIGNIFICANTLY better designed) and only marginally better driving dynamics compared to the the Camry XSE, is why I proclaim the 2018 Camry XSE > 2018 TLX A-spec. 

In conclusion, Acura WANTS you to think you are getting European grade technology, powertrains & driving experience and that all the best ""stuff' from Honda is given to the Acura brand over a mass market brand, but if you know cars, read enough and driven enough cars, you stop caring about ""brands"" and look at what products can be compared to each other. I won't compare a BMW M3 to a Camry XSE, but I can compare between a Civic Type R to a Mercedes CLA 45 AMG. I cannot match a Range Rover Sport to a Toyota Highlander but I CAN cross-shop a Regal GS against a Jaguar XE R-sport. If you cannot see through genuinely close comparisons like that & see beyond the ""class"" & badges, we have nothing to discuss.",4
,,,,,,,,UggWuLtBouFdTHgCoAEC.8U4DXRUCFuc8WpM_TbBBXM,Andrew Zhao,1 year ago,1524058521622,"Nissan Skyline I'm not sure why you keep insisting that I'm a victim or whatever. All I did was see you bashing people about the Camry, then I responded about your opinion of the car normally then you bashed me back for some reason. I'm not playing a victim or anything just discussing cars alright? If you are saying I am just collateral from all those other people that bashed you then we'll end this bashing right here and you can stop calling me ""fucking trash"" for no apparent reason. I had a long reply because I tried to respond to all your points. 

The Type-R is FWD as well. I agree that FWD cars aren't the best for aggressive driving but the new Camry is certainly better equipped for it than the older generations. I wouldn't drive it like an actual sports car but it certainly can handle its own and is way better than the older Camry. That's all I was trying to say about that.

I certainly agree with most of your points about the comparison. Most people that buy a Camry vs Lexus, Infiniti, etc are different buyers. They buy the car for different reasons. But where we differ is how we see the Camry. I may be wrong but it seems like you place a lot of emphasis on the Camry still being a family midsize sedan, which it certainly still is. But this year's model, mainly the XSE V6 trim, tried a little harder to transcend that stereotype by making it sportier. Whether or not it's as sporty as real sports cars, it's irrelevant, the fact is it's clear Toyota tried to push it in that direction, successfully or not. 

But how are we going to tell that to your average less educated buyer? Not people like us who actually care about this stuff and try to learn about these things. You almost have to compare it higher level cars instead of calling it a beefed up Camry. 

In my opinion, people buy those cars for the luxurious aspect of them, not because they perform better than the Camry. I mean, when was the last time a Camry had HP, TQ, tire sizes, gear ratios, even the red leather, etc designed similar to those cars? This is the first time ever Camry has placed such an emphasis on those features, which are usually emphasized only on sportier cars, that is why I am making the comparison. I would have never made this comparison with previous generation Camry's.

Personally for me, I have a 2014 Camry because it is reliable, that's it. Not because it's sporty or whatever because it's not. But to still have the reliability of a Camry and now have sportier features like more HP, TQ, bigger tires, more aggressive gear ratios, etc is a big bonus for Camry buyers. I don't need luxurious or even sporty features on my car, but if I can get them on a Camry when these features are almost exclusively on sportier and much more expensive cars then why not?",3

I said it many times already. Acura cars, as of 2017, are not good. They are American-made garbage. They aren't making and styling them like they used to. Acura pretty much died, in my opinion, when they started the peak grill. However, this does not change the fact their cars are still superior than a Camry XSE. I am not trying to be bias. Don't be bias towards the Camry, please. Stay on the facts. 

The A-Spec model for the TLX should have been the based model. Acura fucked up in this department. This is whole different issue. We aren't talking about Acura versus Lexus. Why bring up Lexus? I already know the IS350 and Q50 Red Sport is a way better car than the TLX. Fun fact: the Red Sport is not in the same segment as the IS350 nor the TLX. It competes with the sub-AMG cars, like the CLA45. The IS350 competes with the regular 3.0T Q50. Get your facts straight. 

By your logic then, the old Camry XLE would better than the Lexus IS200T then too, right? Because the old Camry XLE from 2016 is faster than the IS200T. Hell. The new Camry XSE is better than the Lexus IS200T, right? The new Camry XSE is better than the Audi A4 1.9L, right? The new Camry XSE is better than the 2.0T Q50, right? This is where your logic fails. Take a look at the business model. All top trim Camrys/Accords are faster than the lowest trim Lexus/Acura/Infiniti(G25). Its always been like that. Its the company's way of forcing you to pay more for both the faster car and luxurious car. IE: The V6 Camrys are faster than the low-tier IS trims. But this does not make the V6 Camry a better car or a better ""sports car."" People would still rather get the TLX over the Camry XSE.

The Lexus IS200T/TLX might be slower than the Camry XSE but IS is RWD and the TLX is AWD. At the end of the day, you really going to argue the fact that a 301HP FWD Camry XSE drives better than a IS200T/TLX? You do know there's more to a driving car than slapping a big engine onto it right? 

Opinions. You think the Camry XSE interior and screen design is better than the TLX? Get your eyes checked. I hate the Acura TLX but even I would argue the TLX interior is far superior and feels more expensive than the Camry XSE. 

If you know about cars? Really? You gonna go there when you claim a Camry XSE is a good driver's car. Please. How much cars did you build, kid? My Infiniti G37 Sedan is fully re-done with parts I put on myself. I have a lift in my garage. You wanna talk about ""knowing"" about cars. First; you are gonna have to build and modify cars by yourself. Point: No true true car enthusiasts would agree with you that the Camry XSE is somehow the next coming of a great sports car. However, every true car enthusiasts would agree the new Acuras are bad. But still better than a Camry XSE. 
If you knew anything about cars, you WOULD NOT compare a Civic Type R to a CLA45 AMG. That's totally two different classes. The Type R is compared to the Focus RS and other high-powered hatchbacks. Please re-visit this before talking.",1

DJ Wheat was playing victim. He bashed me first. Its not in this comment section. Its on a different one. Yes. It was collateral. DJ Wheat wasn't the only one point fingers at me for giving a non-so-favorable outlook on the Camry. 

Then that I can agree with you on. FWD is not the best for aggressive driving, especially with a lot of power. That being said, there's nothing wrong with a low HP/TQ FWD car you can toss around. The new 2018 Camry is better equipped. Its more luxurious. My thing was not against the Camry as a car. Its an amazing car, it really is, its a really good standard family sedan with good amenities. However, its just not a sports car nor its a sporty car. While I do agree Toyota is trying their best to curb that image of the Camry, its quite hard to when they aren't using the right formula, in my opinion. I think the Toyota 86 is a great sports car. (Yes. Its low on power. But power is not what makes it a fun or sporty.) Now - if the Camry XSE was made extra special with AWD and comes with a 6sp, I would hands-down agree with you the Camry XSE is no-joke and its sporty. Its just really hard to take a 301HP FWD mid-size sedan as sporty seriously. 

Okay. You see this is where we were divided. You were strictly comparing based off of sporty features while I was comparing the car as a whole. If we were to remove the brand/luxury of both the XSE and TLX, then I feel both cars can be compared. What I feel made it impossible to compare is while the TLX under performs; it feels expensive, luxurious and sitting in one feels welcoming. Thus, the Acura TLX is in the entry level luxury sports sedan segment. While its definitely not as good as say a Lexus IS, its one of those cars for the lower income buyers that want to have luxury. 

At the end. I will agree. The Camry XSE performs better in a straight line compared to the TLX, IS200T, 2.0T Q50, A4 1.9, and all the entry level luxury vehicles. However, when it comes to handling, driving dynamics, aftermarket community with modifications, and etc... that's a totally different situation all together.",1

You are fucking clown. I love it. I love it. You act like you know shit about cars with your ""I bet he doesn't even know Nissan Skyline is basically a G35"". You obviously don't know shit. Only the modern day Nissan Skyline is the Japanese version of the Infiniti G35/G37/Q50.

Continuing on with the Nissan lesson for your uneducated trash ass: the old Nissan Skyline is known for the GT-R variation but now the GT-R its own name-plate. So no - the Nissan Skyline isn't just a G35. It refers to all the GT-Rs R34 and older and the modern day G/Q cars.

When I said multiple branches of car enthusiasts, I was referencing the fucking retards, like yourself, that think Toyota Camrys, Honda Accords and a VW Passats are the best cars in the world. Don't get it wrong. They are all good cars within their segment but they aren't better than say a Acura/Lexus. This is the whole problem with this comment section. People making the Toyota Camry out to be better than luxury vehicles or sports vehicle; hence implies you saying its a ""sports car"". 

Let me enlighten you. If you buy a Toyota Camry as a DD and you have a family but you have a sports car lay around, you are car enthusiasts. If you are a student, a regular joe or any one that can't afford anything but a Toyota Camry, then yes, you can be a car enthusiasts. Hence, you can, which means if you understand your Camry is a great car, an amazing car at that but admits to the things its not. IE: A car enthusiast in this situation would say: ""I'm saving up for a better car but right now I just drive a Toyota Camry. Its a great family car but I want something better."" Then yes, you can be a car enthusiasts because you understand your Camry isn't a car enthusiasts vehicle. When you have idiots, like yourself, running around saying the Toyota Camry is a car enthusiasts car, then you are fucking retard. That's what I'm trying to get at. You idiots are comparing a Toyota Camry XSE V6 to Acura/Lexus and Infinitis. Lets be real here. Toyota Camry XSE V6 great car but those cars are better. 

Here's a definition less for you:
Car enthusiasts - Toyota Camry XSE V6 is a great family car with a bit of power but its not a luxury car or performance sedan. They will never compare them to those vehicles. 
Retarded idiots on this comment section that claim they are car enthusiasts - compares the Camry XSE V6 to luxury or sporty vehicles because it has 301HP now. 

Bottom line: Toyota Camry XSE V6 is not a car enthusiasts car. 
Evidence:
If you think a Camry XSE V6 is a car enthusiasts car, then you are a fucking moron. I don't know but how many Toyota Camry meets has there been in history? Zero, maybe? Turbo Kits for Camrys? SC Kits for Camrys? Cooler kits? Coilover Kits? Huge community following? Let that sink in for a bit.",0

I also recently test driven the Mazda 6 Grand Touring and was impressed as well; it just bites the road and has a very sharp turn in.

I know for a fact the V6 will blow the Mazda's doors off, but what about the handling aspect? I'm itching to get behind the wheel of the Camry XSE to find out myself.

Nissan Skyline the reason why everyone is ""coming at you"" is because you keep mocking us for being car enthusiasts yet we like the Camry. I don't see why we can't be car enthusiasts if we like the Camry. A car enthusiast is someone who appreciates all cars. If someone is really enthusiastic towards a Prius and its technology then all the power to them, but that doesn't make them any less of an enthusiast than someone who has 5 Lambo's in their garage. 

The precedent you are setting by saying the Camry will always be a family car, nothing more nothing less isn't entirely true in the context you're talking about. Is it a sports car? No. Is it a luxury car? No. Is it a family car? Yes it is. But, that certainly does not mean it cannot trend towards being sportier or more luxurious than before. Would you say the new 2018 Camry is sportier and more luxurious than the 2017 Camry? I hope you say yes because it simply is, but does that make it a sports/luxury car? No. Go watch Redline Reviews newest video on the new 2018 Honda Accord. He clearly says both the new Camry and Accord are on the borderline of luxury vehicles with a distinctly sportier feel to them and he is wondering what Acura is doing because the gap that exists between these luxury cars and ""family cars"" isn't so large anymore.

The point I'm making is that you're comparing cars based on a Toyota/Honda badge versus a Lexus/Acura badge and that causes bias and it's clearly showing in your comments.",5

The problem starts when you start comparing a Camry to cars outside of its segment because you feel its an amazing car. Get a grip.,0
,,,,,,,,UggWuLtBouFdTHgCoAEC.8U4DXRUCFuc8YEGFXbvJIC,Andrew Zhao,1 year ago,1524058522513,"@Trades46 The one thing I will say about the Camry XSE V6 is that it doesn't pull as hard as you might expect it to probably because it doesn't have that low-end torque or correctly adjusted gear ratios. It feels more like a smooth but really quick acceleration. In my opinion the steering is much better than before but doesn't bite or grip that much. But, compared to the 2017 and older Camry's it feels much better I promise you that. I think it most definitely replicated at least 7/10 of the Mazda steering, probably closer to 9/10 or more, I think the difference between these two cars in terms of handling won't be too noticeable anymore. 

But I was just saying with the Camry's big leap in HP and torque and overall sportier tune, you might expect (or not) the handling characteristics to make a big leap over its competitors as well but it hasn't. Alas, as Nissan Skyline has eloquently pointed out it is still a ""family car"" and is still tuned for efficiency, comfort, and daily driving. Before I'd say the Camry was by far the numbest of all the family cars in terms of handling and sportiness but now in my opinion it's right up there and comparable to the Mazda and the Accord. I always thought the Mazda was underrated but it's hard to compete with the practicality and reliable reputation Toyota has established.",3
,,,,,,,,UggWuLtBouFdTHgCoAEC.8U4DXRUCFuc8YEIgjvKn_P,Nissan Skyline,1 year ago,1524058522515,"Andrew Zhao I think what everyone is doing is mis-directing my comments. I never intended to mock someone for being a car enthusiasts and like the Camry. In my insult-raged-rant comments, it did come off like that because I was simply replying towards aggression against myself. If you are a car enthusiasts and you like the Camry, sure why the fuck not. It doesn't make you any less of a car enthusiasts. What does is - calling a Toyota Camry a car enthusiasts car. That's my point. A car enthusiasts can like a Camry, can drive a Camry, can do whatever the fuck with it. Marry it. I don't care. My point is when they start calling it a car enthusiast's car. By calling it that, it makes it ""driver's car."" IE: Fun to drive, mountain roads, comparable to cars that are  bred on tracks. A Camry isn't that at all. Has gotten better, you asked? Yes. Obviously. But is it to the range of a car enthusiast's car? I argue not. 

I have always said Acura died when they started the peak grille. All Acura cars from 09+ are horrible. They fucked up. If you go back to my non-aggressive comments, I already admitted that. However, I also pointed out. No matter how much Acura fucked up on the TLX and other vehicles. The Acura TLX is still a better overall car than the Camry XSE V6. That's what you are assuming - brand. Its not the brand. If you compare the interiors of both the Acura TLX and the Camry XSE V6, the Acura interior is about 10 times more refined. It feels like you are in a luxury vehicle. While the Camry XSE V6 does feel more expensive than the past, it doesn't feel the same as the Acura TLX. You get dual screens in the Acura. Better sound system. AWD. Softer and comfortable ride. More soft touch material. My point is there are a lot of little things that add up. To sum up. Is the Acura TLX shit? Yes. Is the Camry XSE V6 better than before? Yes. Is the Camry XSE V6 better than the TLX. No. 
^That's the point I made without insults and I got insulted. This is how it all started. Watch, within a few hours, more people will spam me and talk about how much of an idiot I am. What are they going to expect? A friendly reply?  

Side note: Someone on here actually used an argument of saying the Toyota Camry is better because it has electronic e-brake and the Acura TLX don't. Well. If features and luxury equipment are measured by e-brakes, then the Toyota Camry is better than the M4 too by that argument since the M4 still uses a hand pull e-brake.

Again my points are: Car enthusiasts can like whatever car they want. A Camry is not a car enthusiast's car. The Toyota Camry XSE V6 is a great family car that gotten better but not better than the Acura TLX/Lexus IS200T still. 

I have already watched that video. The Honda Accord 2.0T Sport is more of ""car enthusiast's car"" than the Camry XSE V6. What's the difference? 6SpMT option.",0

You are the only person here I respect so far. You give a fair and non-objective view on the Camry. Its good to see that. From my experience, quite a bit of the people here are really bias towards the Camry, which is fine. But, its problematic when there are comments that say the Camry XSE V6 handles better than an Acura TLX and etc... Its just not possible for a 301HP FWD car to handle better than an AWD car.

However the fact in operates on Atkinson cycle in low rpms seems to hurt the 2.5L A25A-FKS ability to rev from what I see on other YT channels. Again I reserve the final claims until I actually experience that myself. I also haven't manged to find much info on the A25A engine outside of Toyota's press releases; is it a further developed 2AR-FE motor or an all-new design? 

I do know for a fact the Toyota 2GR V6 is a heck of a smooth engine, and one reason I love this current gen Camry (despite the hate from a certain Mr. S & others on YT) is Toyota stuck to what they knew and kept the V6 option, albeit a rather pricey one.",1

Considering the 2018 Camry is its first application and noting the structural changes to fit into the new TNGA platform with those huge improvements in overall efficiency and power it defintetly feels like an all new-design. The changes and modifications made certainly are more comprehensive than the 2AR-FSE and FXE. 

I know the V6 motor is a further developed 2GR-FE variant that's found in the current Tacoma, Highlander, Sienna, and I believe the Lexus GS 350 as well, but I have no complaints there. I loved the smoothness of the 2GR-FE as well and I'm glad Toyota stuck with the V6.

Didn't you call me a fucking retard for also mentioning the Accord can also be enthusiasts car in the midsize category in a earlier comment?  You also changed your mind with the Civic too. See you can't even back up your own argument.  So a car has to have a 6 speed MT in order to be an ""enthusiast's car"" as you claimed.  What about a modern Ferrari, like a Portofino, 488, GTC4Lusso? They don't offer any MT but a semi automatic, the paddle shifters used in a F1 formula racer. Are those not an enthusiasts' car just because they don't offer a stick? Also FYI, the 2018 Camry XSE and SE offers F1 Formula paddle shifters and if the features were ever to be swapped, the Accord offering the paddle shifters and the Camry offers the 6 speed manual, I guarantee you will definitely still say something like offering a 6 speed manual in a Camry is retarded like you did when you learned it offers up to 301 HP.

For the new Honda Accord, it was disappointing to see Honda getting rid of the iconic V6, in favour of a 2.0L Turbo. The base 1.5L Turbo will also get a fucking CVT....... bummer.....

No. I would say the exact same shit if Mazda put a quad-exhaust system on the Mazda 6. I would say the same shit if Honda put a quad-exhaust on a Honda Accord. What I was saying is - no cars in this segment should have a quad-exhaust system. Y'all think you guys are M3/M4 drivers or something? If you think the Camry or any car in Camry's segment need a quad-exhaust system, then you clearly don't know shit about cars. Any true real car enthusiast would agree a Camry with quad-exhaust is just retarded. 

The design is subjective. I am only knocking on the Camry because Toyota is trying to make the Camry sporty. Only idiots complain that the Camry needs to be more sporty/sporty looking. Its a fucking Camry. No one buys a Camry and thinks they'll be king of the streets. A Camry should not be sporty, period. A Camry is a DD family sedan. Most people only complained about the older generations Camry's ugly design. What Toyota should have done is not make it sporty but make it just a good design in general.  IE: Keep all those nice LED lights and lose the quad-exhaust and sharp lines. 

You, apparently, don't know shit about cars. I mean,  you think a Camry is fine with a quad-exhaust system. You also think the Camry is not a boring car to drive. LOL. My god. I swear. When I read that, I thought this kid is fucking retarded. The Toyota Camry is the definition of boring to drive. To dispute this just makes you look like a retard. 

Addition proof you fail to understand cars: you think a V6 Accord would be better than a Turbo Accord. The Turbo will be based off the Civic Type R turbo. It will have produce more power than the V6. It will produce more low-end torque which get the Accord off the line much quicker.

You clearly fail to understand the basics of fun-to-drive or what makes it an engaging car. I'm just going to let your retarded statement stand. Any real car enthusiasts will just laugh in your face if you claim a Camry is fun to drive. I mean, your dumbass thinks quad-exhaust on a Camry is a good thing. That in itself should already disqualify you from saying anything about cars. 

FYI: Honda Civics have been boring and will always be boring. There's only 2 fun Honda Civics you would want to buy, if you want an engaging experience. The Honda Civic SI and Civic Type R. Anything other than those 2 - you are getting a run of the mill simple Honda Civic. 

Oh. So that's your biggest argument? That I'm a Honda fanboy? Not even close. I'm a car junkie. I'm not sure if you notice, but I modify cars during my spare time. I'm objective to all car makers and cars. Honda, for years, have been making boring cars. Their best cars were from the past. IE: S2000. Clearly, you also failed at reading comprehension as well. I did not say because its a Camry, it can't be attractive. I said, its a Camry, its not suppose to be sporty. What I want Toyota to do is to make a Camry that is great in design while keeping the beauty of the DD family sedan style. Instead - Toyota made the car look sporty, when its not sporty. What's the point of that? What's the function of that? What's the point of a quad-exhaust system on a Camry? Answer me this - why does a non-performance car need quad-exhaust? 

To be real with you - I would never buy a Toyota Camry or a Honda Accord. Even as a DD, I will look into the realm of entry-level sports cars. IE: Lexus, Infiniti, EVO X, STI, There goes your argument of calling me bias against Toyota.",3

Hell, I even heard that Toyota tried to also attract the youth at the same time with this new Camry, besides the typical Camry buyers.

Again, I know that the Camry has NEVER been fun to drive, but an all-new platform and double-wishbone rear suspension might kind of change that for this 8th gen we have here. Personally, I find the quad-exhaust an interesting styling detail, and the models with the quad-exhaust does include rev-matching. Fuck, it even gives the regular I4 a bit more power, over 200 horsepower that is, with no turbos required, lol.

With these numerous details I've mentioned, I can tell that Toyota is trying to make the Camry a different car compared to what it has always been.

I'm talking specifically about the Camry XSE. The rest of the Camry's line-up is fine - it doesn't look boring and its not trying to be something its not. The Camry XSE is where I have a problem. Its a car trying to be sporty, when its not and never will be. Toyota can dress the Camry XSE in all these sporty designs and quad-exhaust, but it won't make the car better. A true car enthusiasts will never buy this piece of garbage.

Again, like I said before, an all-new platform and double-wishbone rear suspension is not the only ingredients for a better driving and engaging car. There's whole host of engineering and structures that must be done for a car to be truly a jewel of driving. My guess is you never driven anything remotely sporty, huh? I drove many Camrys. They make great rental cars for long distance drives, but they are boring as fuck. Overall - is Camry a great car? Yes. Is Camry a sporty car? Hell no. To think otherwise makes you look stupid. I find it fucking harmonious that you think the quad-exhaust is an interesting style detail. You know who else thinks big exhaust and multiple exhaust tips on useless cars are a good style detail? Ricers. The difference is, the Camry comes from the factory with quad-exhaust. The quad-exhaust is plain stupid. Its not required on a fucking Camry. Give me  reasonable explanation why quad-exhaust on a non-performance car that makes only 301HP is good then I'll shut up about it. That is basically my biggest problem with the Camry XSE. FYI: 1) Its not a called a regular I4. Its called a N/A I4. 2) Turbo I4 produce more than N/A I4. A Turbo I4 will have a lower displacement, which means better fuel economy. A Turbo I4 will produce more torque, which means faster acceleration. You blatantly ignorant when it comes to cars. 

Rev-matching on an automatic Camry? LOL. Thanks for that information. This just made the Camry more retarded and cringey. Why the fuck does a Camry need rev-matching? Yeah. I know it has sports mode.

My problem is - idiots like you thinking the Camry XSE is the rival to sports sedans with the quad-exhaust system. Dude. The Camry XSE is trying to be a ""sports Camry"", but it's not. It never will be. Its a total joke and trash of a car. Who the fuck buys a Camry as an enthusiasts car? You'll be labeled as a ricer and a fucking idiot.

If you think the Camry XSE, any Camry or even the Mazda 6 is ""driver's car"", you better get your fucking brain checked out. No. Get it through your thick fucking head. The fucking Camry XSE and the other version of the Camry IS NOT a driver's car. How can a 301HP FWD big family sedan be a driver's car? Explain please. Do you know what a fucking driver's car is? How fucking retarded can you be? 
Side note: FWD can be fun cars to drive depending on their torque steering prevention system. Many hothatches are FWD, fast, and fun to drive. IE: Honda Civic Type R. The Camry XSE does not fit into this category.

To be real with you, I don't give a fuck what you think because you clearly know nothing about cars. What experience do you have? I mean, clearly, none, if you think a Camry is a driver's car. 
Lets take a look at the garbage statement you just made - 
""Also, the quad-exhaust gives more horsepower. While you think it's it stupid, it actually serves a purpose."" 

Yes. An exhaust system gives more power, but not the number of fucking exhaust tips you have*, you raging retard. *IE: An aftermarket exhaust system will give on average ~3HP/1TQ depending on the engine's tune - it could be more. It could be single outlet, dual outlet or quad-outlet. My problem with the Camry XSE is that the quad-exhaust is fucking useless. Get that through your retarded brain. Or if you have time, learn about cars before talking, you fucking retard. The Camry XSE's quad-exhaust is purely useless cosmetics*. Hence - garbage. This is where your clear understanding of cars fails you. The 2018 Camry XSE could have obtain the same amount of HP (301HP) from the same exhaust system, the dual exhaust system from the 2017 Camry XSE. The thing is, the fucking thing is, the Camry XSE is not a fucking BMW M3/M4. So explain to me, again, why do you fucking need a quad-exhaust system on a Camry? Is it producing 444HP like the M3/M4? Again, the Camry is a great DD family sedan. *Its not a great driver's car. 

You think a Camry XSE is just as sporty as an Acura TLX, which has stiffer suspensions, a lower ride height, more aggressive gearing ratio, AWD system, and etc...? Yup. You are fucking retarded. More power? Sure. The Camry XSE has 11 more HP than the TLX, while they both have the same amount of torque. But this power, does it translate to be better in performance and more fun to drive? No. The TLX performs better than the Camry XSE. The SH-AWD system will help the TLX put down more HP/TQ to the wheels while the Camry XSE's FWD won't. So, when a TLX and XSE race, the TLX will have more WHP/WTQ thus beating the Camry XSE. At the end of it all, the roughly 7K-10K, depending on packaging, is worth it. 

The Camry is not fun to drive nor its meant to be raced. Get that through your thick head. Keep thinking the Camry XSE is fun the drive because clearly you haven't driven an actual car that is fun to drive.",3

LOL ok that's cool. It's not always about comestics when you're talking about performance. How can you say this Camry is boring without driving one. When you actually take a test drive behind a XSE, then come back to complain like a baby. Yes, Acura's Super-Handling All Wheel Drive system is great which helps it achieve better acceleration times and traction, but that's the only plus.Yes, 11 more hp and 1 more pounds feet of torque can make a difference. The current 2017 does 0-60 in 5.8 SECONDS just imagine how fast this will be now that it has a more poweful engine with a lighter chassis. If the Camry offered AWD, it would just show how much cheaper you can get it. Why can't family sedans can't be fun to drive since I see most mid-size car buyers are younger than what you think??? When did I say this was a close to M4?! Please tell me when?? M4 is a performance car. There's a difference between a sports or a sporty car and straight performance cars. I'm not making it seem like it's some car you take out on a track. Most definitely not. It's just as fun to drive around corners like the 6 and the Accord. Get that through your thick ass skull! Like Soyfan said, you can finally take the Camry on one of your favorite back roads and it can take the corners great. Never did I say it is better than the M4 or it should be compared to an M4. If this car is getting compared to the Maxima and/or the TLX, it just shows how much Toyota has grown, how great of a fun to drive it is, and what it offers at a much cheaper price point. Not everyone can afford that Lexus IS, Acura TLX, BMW 3 or 5 series, so take that into consideration. More exhaust outlets= more air for the engine to breathe and give out more hp numbers. FWD family cars can be fun to drive whether you think so or not. Proven so with this car, Accord, the Fusion, the Malibu, the Optima, and maybe the 2018 Sonata. Like I said, the Camry is now drivers car like the Mazda 6 and the Accord period. I can't stand to argue with ignorant people like you who thinks they are right all the damn time.. Lol. The times have changed and now the Camry can be advertised as sporty!",1

Explain to me again how is converting the Infiniti G to a Nissan Skyline 350GT ricer? How is it fucking ricer to convert it back to its original name? You do know they are 100% the exact same fucking car, right? Its pretty much known as the Nissan Skyline 350GT to the rest of the world. This is same for majority of Acura cars too. Its the Honda NSX to the world while Acura NSX to the USA. You are one dumb fucking kid. You think modding a Camry is not ricer while modding a Infiniti G is ricer. You clearly have no fucking clue what ricer means. Besides, this 2018 Camry XSE, you have your dick hard for, comes fully ricer from the factory. What Camry needs a quad-exhaust system? 

Secondly, ""Black out that white beak/nose. Limo tint. All black wheels. Lowering springs. Spacers. Debadge. Done."" - your quote. You want to know how this is ricer? Because you are making the Camry XSE look fast when its not fast. What you are driving is a blacked out, lowered, eco-friendly family sedan. How the fuck is that not rice? And lowering springs? Who the fuck needs to lower a Camry? Are you going to the track and do hair-pin turns? Bottom line: Any modifications towards a Camry, Accord, Mazda6 or any car within the family sedan category is fucking rice. They are amazing family cars but leave the fucking modifications out of it. You'll ruin the car and make yourself look like a fucking retard. 

Thirdly, you called a Infiniti G a piece of shit car? Harmonious. Just fucking harmonious. This piece of Infiniti G that is 7 years old can still pull faster 0-60 times and quarter miles than your fucking retarded ricer 2018 Camry XSE with quad-exhaust. Explain, again, how is the Infiniti G a piece of shit when its 7 years old but still faster than the 2018 Lexus IS350, 2018 Mercedes Benz C-Class, 2018 BMW 328i, 2018 Audi A4 and a shit ton of other cars of this class-range?

You said, and I quote, ""both of these cars perform extremely similar; weight, power, fuel economy, family friendly interiors"" Yeah. No. You are 100% wrong here. Lets start with power/weight: The Lexus IS200T, 300, and 350 all out perform the Camry V6 XSE in every way possible. If we are talking raw numbers and performance, the Camry is no where similar to the Lexus IS. The Lexus is much smaller and lighter compared to the Camry. The Lexus has a lower stance which provides more G on corners. The Lexus IS has much more aftermarket parts for performance improvements. Camry in the aftermarket scene? Don't be a ricer. The Camry is a FWD making 301HP and the Lexus IS RWD. While FWD cars can be fun and awesome handling cars too, Camry isn't one of them. A Camry isn't a Civic Type R. And for fuel economy - Camry is just better, not similar to the Lexus IS. Family friendly interiors is so subjective. The Lexus IS does not have a family friendly interior. I would argue it has a driver friendly interior with those F-Sport gauges to direct controls mostly the driver can mange. IE: The trackpad.",2

Lexus IS are heavy cars, the lightest one, the IS200t is 1680kg. The most powerful IS350 is still around 1700kg. Yet the new 2018 Camry V6 uses a very similar engine to the IS350, but weighs around 1500kg (Can't actually find exact specs). From this, the Camry would have better P/W. The Lexus IS is not much smaller and definitely not lighter than the Camry. Yeah, it doesn't have as much leg room in the back, but the overall length for both vehicles would be similar. Our 2017 Lexus IS is almost as long as our fucking Mitsubishi Triton haha.
I also disagree that it doesn't have a family friendly interior. It has pretty much what a family needs; bottle holders, rear air vents, heated and cooled front seats and the track pad is definitely usable for the front passenger, but overall it's a non intuitive system. What the IS misses though is a shit ton of tech, no apple car play, no electronic park brake, no heads up, no 3D park, no auto park assist. These are features that appear in $30k AUD VW Golfs. Funny thing is, many of these features like electronic park brake and 3D park are seen in this new generation Camry. So yeah, if we were to take off the badges, I think this 2018 Camry is better than the 2017 Lexus IS, which is still pretty much from 2013 to be fair.",0

I'm not sure what specs you are looking at or maybe its different in your country. Here are the US specs: 3583lbs for the IS200T and 3593lbs for the IS350. This is straight from the Lexus website. These figures does not make the Lexus IS heavy at all. However, it is lighter than the 2017 Camry XSE which weighs in at about 3350lbs. (There's no hard numbers for the 2018 Camry XSE yet so lets not talk about the weight there) 

That being said, you are dreaming if you truly believe a Camry XSE is faster than a Lexus IS350. Lets just look at the raw specs and judge ourselves, shall we? 

The Lexus IS350 makes about 305HP and 277 torque. The 2018 Camry makes about 301HP and 267 torque. By those numbers alone, the Lexus IS350 is already faster. This excludes talking about the Lexus being RWD, which means less HP will be lost to the wheels. This excludes talking about the wider, sportier tires the Lexus has on the rear wheels which provides more grip off the line. This excludes talking about Lexus IS' aggressive gearing ratio, which means harsher acceleration off the line. (Lexus' aggressive gearing is what make the older generation IS350 keep up with the G37) So no. The 2018 Camry is not faster than the Lexus IS350. Toyota is not stupid enough to let that happen. If that happened, that's bad for business. 

The Lexus IS F Sport models are more engaging for the driver. Hence - majority of the tech is placed in such a way where the driver gets the best experience. Its true. The front passenger can get to use it too. But, things like the trackpad, is specifically placed for the driver. This is what I was trying to get at At the end of it all, the Camry has a more family friendly environment. 

""What the IS misses though is a shit ton of tech, no apple car play, no electronic park brake, no heads up, no 3D park, no auto park assist"" You clearly don't understand the business side of things. Toyota wouldn't make the Camry more luxurious with more features than their Lexus models. This is why majority of the stuff on this list don't matter to the majority of luxury buyers. I mean, does the Camry XSE have a large screen for navigation? Mark Levinson sound system? 3 different drive modes? F sport gauges where you can have full customization? Better quality and made with better materials? 

So no, even if you take off the badges, the Lexus still has the more luxurious interior with better built quality with better materials.",0

The 2018 Camry shown in this video has a pretty incredible interior. Plenty of soft touch materials on the dash just like our Lexus IS. One big complaint I do have with our Lexus is that it has an audible rattling noise coming under our gear lever. It was present for most of our 2 Hr trip to the Blue Mountains here in NSW so I dismiss any claims on build quality. Honestly along with the hard plastics used in the door bottle holders which would also rattle constantly, the drive was very unpleasant.

Look I agree with the large 10.3 inch screen in the 2017 IS and the availability of ML audio on the $80k AUD model (we don't have this model) are pretty nice, but the mouse pad is just so finicky to use and takes a lot out of the wow factor from the large screen.",0

The platform argument holds no weight. Camry having a newer platform does not make it better than the Lexus IS. It just shows its on a new generation. Evidence of this is that: the new 2018 Camry XSE is not even better than the Lexus IS350 from the 2006 era as a whole. It might be better than the 06 Lexus IS in terms of tech, but not everything else.",0

While I do agree, from the video, the Camry XSE interior is much nicer than the older models. I would not agree its nicer than the Lexus IS. The Lexus IS interior is crafted better and with better material. You can tell from pictures alone the Lexus IS interior feels more expensive. Was your Lexus a rental? If its not, you might want to get that noise checked out. Like the Camry, the Lexus does have plastic. We are still talking about an entry-level luxury car. However, this does not dismiss the fact the Lexus has better quality than the Camry. 

I agree, the trackpad on the Lexus is pretty dumb. I would prefer a touchscreen, personally. My point on the trackpad was that it's placed in a position that benefits the driver rather than the passenger. I never said it was good.",0

The most obvious reason is Toyota isn't stupid enough to shoot themselves in the foot by having a cheaper car better. Secondly, you can't justify not having Apple Car Play, 3D Park Assist, or Heads up display as tech that makes the Camry better. That's ludicrous because those options aren't considered ""luxury items"". The Lexus has a boat load of options (non-fluff and luxury options) a Camry owner could only dream off. By your logic, the 2018 Camry would be better than Lexus and its competitors. IE: Infiniti, Acura, BMW and Mercedes Benz entry-level vehicles (Which all of them does not have those tech options you mentioned.) 

No. I am not a Lexus IS owner. I personally think the Lexus IS, being marketed as an entry-level sport sedan, does not hold its ground well enough versus its competitors in terms of performance. I'm neither bias for or against Lexus IS or Camry. My opinion stands - the 2018 Camry is simply just not better than the Lexus IS350.",0

Because its literally Google giving the maps to Audi. Audi did not design the features nor the graphics. Its literally just Google Maps but on the car. This actually would be consider cheap, not luxury. I would argue, a luxury company, would put out their own design for their own maps. This makes map special, one of a kind, versus Audi's Google Maps that even a kid with iPhone has. This theory holds true for Apple/Android car play. This is not a luxury feature. Why? Cheap vehicles in Dodge and Chevy have them. 

Back to the point: the Camry XSE is simply not better than the Lexus IS350. The Lexus IS350 has better performance. Has better built quality. Built with better materials. Made with fewer plastics. Bigger screen. Smoother interface. Better graphics. Better sound system. Everything feels expensive. Made in Japan.

Its the business structure of the game. All top line V6 models of Accord/Camry are faster than the entry level car of their luxury brand. Its structured this way to force people to pay more.",0

Exactly. That's what I have been saying. Its not about the car. Its the business. Toyota/Honda will never make the Camry/Accord better than their Lexus/Accord counterparts.

Definitely. Its a smart business move to structure the prices that way. It makes people pay.

The 2018 Lexus IS300 RWD Turbo is only roughly ~5K more expensive than the XSE V6. If you have an extra 5G laying around, I'll say do the new 2018 Lexus IS. The Lexus IS300 (200T) will be slower than the XSE V6 to 60 and the quarter mile, but, how likely are you going to be racing a Camry? The Lexus IS will be more luxurious and will be engaging to drive since Toyota/Lexus tuned the engine/suspension to be ""sporty"" since they market this car as their ""sports sedan.""",0
