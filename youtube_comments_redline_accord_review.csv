Ugz3S-gIDMwznFzYUuh4AaABAg,Matthew Muscarella,3 months ago,1547580815374,"I just recently bought a new 2019 Honda Accord 2.0T Sport manual and I love it. I did come from a 16' WRX, and there are things to miss about that car but I truly love this car because it is now what I am looking for. This is extremely comfortable and easy to drive anywhere despite how long it is. It is also very spacious inside the cabin and in the trunk; easily haul 5 passengers and their stuff in the trunk for a road trip. I like how quiet this car is at highway speed, and the gear ratios are made for the most fuel economy at highway speeds. 

To be honest I have very few gripes about this car. One is how a family sedan comes with 19"" 235/40 low profile tires (moreso than my WRX). My issue isn't ride quality, it feels just fine, but the fact I have to spend that much more money to replace tires when the time comes. It won't be cheap. Another gripe is I would have preferred analog dials in the dash versus that LCD. It has good functionality, but from a long term reliability stand point I'd prefer analog dials. If ever that LCD were to malfunction that could potentially be quite an expensive fix. Lastly, that back end does look rather terrible. Not a fan of those lobster claw tail lights. 

Thus far I've been averaging 32 mpg on mostly highway driving on the first couple tanks. That's pretty much what it is rated at, but I expect I can get better mpg later when the engine is fully broken in, I only use Shell gas, and I can use my chosen engine oil (likely Castrol Edge Full Synthetic for GDI Turbo engines). It is also not a slow car by any means. It cannot compete with my WRX, but it is not slow. It also handles quite well around corners despite being a large sedan.

Overall, I still love this Accord. It is everything I want in a car now from reliability, to build quality, to pure comfort on the road. 

Thank you for your review, it was a factor in helping me decide to get this car!",0,false,0,,,,,,

The hating on the 10th gen design seems to be driven from previous gen pride of ownership more than anything else - loyalty towards a certain look, more than any objective perspective on the design across all its iterations.

Sorry people: Accords were almost always rather plain-looking and they generally do not stand out. It was only once I recently began to consider eventually buying one that i began to ""see"" previous gens driving past again.

The loyalty to a particular previous design and setup seems limited to Some of 9th gen models, as absolutely everything else was very plain and has no ground from which to criticize anything by comparison. 

First if you think only coupes look good you are fighting a battle you can only win on your own one-person team versus yourself, sorry.

So that just leaves the 2017 sporty looks themselves, regardless the number of doors. Do you really mean to suggest the bulbous trunk and gigantic lights of the 2017 Touring is not awkward as hell?

Once again perspective seems totally lacking. By the same arguments everyone throws at the 10th gen, the 9th gen would also be chock full of awkward style cues that only look good at certain angles and even specific lighting.",0,false,0,,,,,,

This new design just doesn't grow on you easily, in fact people who hate the current Civic design must hate this too. I would go with Camry since it still has V6 and I just prefer V6 over anything, but Camry interior is just not very attractive, and the exterior is not exactly winning me over either, it may be best to just skip this generation of sedans and keep driving a crossover, I mean as much as I like the driving dynamics of a sedan, the value of a crossover is simply unbeatable for the price, basically only $1,000 or so more than a sedan but gives you so much more in return, like how Toyota Highlander is basically the same price as Camry's V6, yet the features it has and versatility is simply too good to pass up.

I just turned in a Lexus ES350 and that car was sloppy around corners and it sucked on gas not to mention it had the worst brakes right after a Ford or a Kia product. Anyway, this car is not bad. I got the car for $27,900 so it helped me get over not having a V6 a bit. The Mercedes Benz C class and the BMW 3 series have 4 cylinders unless you go to an M3 or M4 and then you can get a 6 cyl but it has a turbo. I was very fortunate to lease a 2010 BMW M3 with a V8 7spd DCT but that car was over $72,000. Just so you guys know there are new TV's that cost more than the new Accord I just got. SONY, SAMSUNG and LG have amazing flat 4K HDR TV's that are so good looking and like I said it costs more than the Accord Sport or not. Bottom line is this car is just to get around for now. I have to wait for 2020 or 2021 until the car I really want from BMW to come out and work out the kinks before I put down a $100K for a nice ride. To the people who like the Camry over this....May I suggest going to your local eye doctor and getting your eyes looked at. The Camry is ugly as they come. Every car has a look to it and it can be considered ugly but the Honda is by far the ""Ugliest"" beast out there. The car drives better than a Camry, outruns any V6 they have or make so coming from a 4cyl that beats a Camry with more horsepower is another slap in the face of Toyota. The reason why Toyota's sell more is because they whore those cars out, not to mention they have great leases compared to Honda. The dealers were and still are begging Honda Financial to get their asses out of their heads and make a great lease for ALL Honda Accord's because they are collecting dust just sitting there. I got the price I got because I know how to buy cars thanks to Grant Cardone. I never get screwed by any dealer and getting this over $3,000 back of MSRP was a really good deal. I was going to get the Civic Type R but the 2018.5 cars are not out yet and one of the guys that worked at Honda gave me a business car of a company that does Stage 1 and Stage 2 for only $600 to $695 depending who the referral comes from and it makes it have more HP than the Civic Type R. I am sure that will screw with the warranty but I don't give a rats ass. Honda's are super reliable and I want more HP and more torque for sure, why not?? So to the people who like knocking the Accord, go ahead and do that and enjoy the slower, uglier and definitely no Apple Car Play or Android Auto in their vehicles....Enjoy your rides.",2,true,1,,,,,,

That being said, that didn't stop Honda from selling around 20,000 of these last month (February 2018). Again, granted the Camry sold around 30,000, but when you factor in the 18%-20% of those went to fleets (taxi, rental fleets, etc.) it comes out to around 24-25,000. Which is still more than the Accord, but not as much as all the Toyota fanboys will try to lead you to believe, which as it turns out is due to all of the incentives Toyota is throwing at the new Camry. But whatever, both are very good cars you can't go wrong buying either one, I personally prefer the Accord but that's just me.

HP is rarely a consideration since a family sedan rarely gets close to top speed. If you want acceleration, then it's torque you should be looking at not HP.¬†

as for why they detuned it down so much, It's a family sedan. The people who buy these cars aren't type-r owners. Honda can't expect the same level of car care. It also has to run on regular gas, which simply won't work well if theres 23psi of boost rammed into the block.",3

There are plenty of car manufacturers that produce a four door sedan with more power and greater handling. I've been eyeballing the Dodge Charger for a while. I was waiting for Honda to give me a reason to say no to Dodge but unfortunately they have not. My next car will probably be a Charger. I don't need seat cooling and all that infotainment garbage.

Their Sonata makes over 280hp with about 250 lb of torque (I forgot) and has grown over thr honda in terms of a reliable car.

The current Mazda6 has more power than its setup can handle, still only offers the dated Infotainment (400 bucks or more to upgrade it after, we hear..), and the Mazda6 is currently built in Japan while the Accord is built in Ohio thus providing way more North American jobs we would hope though technically by even selling the car in NA that creates a lot of jobs.

And yeah the long-term quality level is uncertain. Our Mazda3 engine or transmission never had an issue in 8 years 150k miles, but we Cannot say the same for the rest of the car. Our impression is that Honda has more control of the full lifecyle of All components of the vehicle, such as a very pricey abs sensor that would cost thousands to replace if it should ever fail. Honda would provide their own, specifically set up for that exact car, and would compensate for things like a lazy mechanic not bleeding the brakes - you'd have spongy brakes until this is rectified... but your sensor would not abruptly fail 6 months later. This is our general impression of Honda versus Mazda in terms of long-term quality. 

By 8 years our Mazda 3 was a rusting, very aged looking bland car, sitting in the driveway with brake fluid leaking from some unknown location and had gone everywhere, after multiple brake issues that nobody could seem to fix, not to mention a cabin air filter so tedious to replace you need to remove the entire glove box and mess with the fuse panel, only to have the capability to install it backwards anyway while that Should be impossible by filter design. And how did leaves physically get in there? Yuck.

And then there was the.. heck what was it.. ah yes the AC Compressor failing, because they positioned it in a silly very low spot on the chassis and salt had been packing itself up in there every winter and just corroded everything out. 

Or how about our long-time friend who did a stint as a Mazda salesperson and even in that short amount of time somehow became a liar and a bit of a con. ""Yep 5-star all around."" They answered about my safety rating question. Wrong! Then we walked out of their after all their ""Discounts"" basically paying sticker price, for a base model so the cost wasnt through the roof. Do not buy from friends people, it relinquishes all your capacity to negotiate.

We also had multiple bad experiences over those 8 years with multiple Mazda dealers and their repair centers, while Honda service on the same street has always been top notch. So yeah.

Currently if we want Android autoplay in our CX-5, Madza is holding that Ransom (and will do the Same to you even for your 2018 Mazda6) for 400 dollars or more after labour and tax. So yeah.

If you would be happy with the general drive and feel of a Mazda, you will do just fine. If every Detail and the long-term experience matters, my vote is still with Honda.",0

You are also trying to convince someone based solely on reliablity to not buy the accord. Not everyone thinks that reliability is the sole reason to buy a car. The only people I know that solely consider reliability as the utmost of importance are people who buy toyota.

SUVs will continue to grow in market demand simply because they offer better view of the road and it's lurking potholes and other dangers, especially if you are a short person.  Overall however prices are good value for money.  Compare this to a BMW 530i 2 liter turbo for $60K in basic trim, you can buy 2 Accords, and I can promise you one thing; the maintenance cost and trouble on the Accord is going to be a lot less which makes it hold it's resale value better than it's German counterparts.

Toyota will not offer as many luxurious features on the Camry because they wouldn't want it to compete with their own Avalon.  Honda doesn't have that problem as the Accord represents their highest end sedan.  So things such as cooled seats and the nicer interior would be reserved for the newer Avalon.  Also, it appears to me that with the 2018 Camry that Toyota is really trying to heighten the differences between it and the Avalon.  The Camry is now more sportier while I expect the new Avalon will set itself as being more luxurious and refined.  Just some things to keep in mind.",0,false,0,,,,,,

I like using chopsticks with certain foods from time to time but, I wouldn't want to use them for every meal and everyday.  Try sitting in traffic with a manual.  Give me my Porsche and it better have a manual.  Stop with these ordinary family sedan sporty manual reviews.  You don't by an Accord or a Camry if you want to feel bumps or be annoyed by a manual.  It's why THEY WERE INVENTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.    You can see where these companies save the money.  Materials and body structure/feeling of quality when you close the door.  Close a door on an older BMW.  You need a sledgehammer.  That's how you build a car.  Quality structurally.    A 2.0T is not to be sporty.  It's for weight reduction and MPG.  A 10 speed or CVT is for MPG as well.  You don't see a CAT in a Ferrari.  You know all this.   Review it as if you were a vanilla consumer that wants the most bang for the buck.  These cars do that.  I personally like the styling of the old touring Accord.  They made it look like a Mercedes and 2 screens and not a tablet stuck on that I have to touch is worse in my opinion.   Furthermore, 4WD should be offered on all in this class.  Hybrids, not older than petrol energy electric power, should be the standard on the majority of vehicles.  Batteries are older technology than petrol to power.   The Accords wheels are worse that the last vehicle and the integrated tailpipe are a good upgrade.

1) Unless I'm eating soup for obvious reasons there are TON'S of people use chopsticks every day. Hell I use chopsticks to cook out of sheer laziness to take out a spatula. 

2) I deal with an hr of bumper to bumper traffic everyday in my manual (most of it is hills as well) . It's not an issue. I honestly would still take the manual as it keeps my commute more exciting than zombie driving around in an AT. 

3) some people DO want a manual in their family sedans. More often than not a family sedan may be the only car the family has. We may not be able to get a ""porsche with a manual"" for the fun times. We may not even have a second car in general. So it makes sense if you want a little more engagement out of your daily putter to get a car in a manual.

4) Why do you consider driving a manual to be a compromise. I don't see how it's an annoying experience. It's all muscle memory. 

5) I don't really agree with AWD being standard. Optional yes, but not standard. There are trade-offs since A sedan is so much lower than a Crossover, the drive shaft takes up  much more space. If you have to carry 5 people often, then FWD is  probably preferred (and yes I live with Canadian winters, FWD is fine with some decent winter tires and common skills)",0

I love the V6 sound too, but in a family sedan, I think a turbo 4 makes more sense. More torque down low for city driving, and better fuel economy when you don't get on boost.",0

All it does is make a it a higher flowing head. All of the modern engines use forced induction, the tiny amount of difference that a higher lift cam gives at stock tune is practically zero when the whole intake manifold is pressurized during load.

The VTEC on the K20C series is an exhaust only system. it increases lift and duration on the exhaust side so that more of the gasses are expelled, which means the turbo spools faster. It's a way to reduce turbo-lag, the fact he doesn't feel anything, means it works. 

As for the choice of engines, yes it's a new engine. The reliability is unkown. But it's not like the J35 was a perfect engine. I still remember all the issues with VCM, killing spark-plugs, burning oil, misfires. Personally If I had to choose between an engine with a turbo or an engine with VCM, I would take the turbo.",3

From my daily driving, hill-hold is more than good enough to keep you steady. And if you really need more time, then Brake Hold gives you infinite time. The system doesn't release the brake until it detects enough torque being sent to the wheels to hold the car steady. I honestly find myself more smooth with hillstarts with this system than with a manually releasing the e-brake.

As for emergency situations, you can still pull it in ANY situation. 

The only downside I can think of is you can't release it unless you have power, but in today's time portable jumpers are so common I don't see it being too big of an issue.",0

THANK-YOU Honda for going against the trend and putting back actual KNOBS for infotainment. I also noticed that the climate control almost look like a unit stolen straight off the Audi A3. Still the interior trim feels...hollow, something I Toyota did better on the new Camry. I do however like the new digital dashboard, and traditional dial display is much better than the digital unit on the current Civic & Odyssey. 

I'm on the fence about the 2.0T. Obviously fuel economy & emissions are important, but Toyota just proven a 3.5L V6 could achieve both while getting 300hp. That Camry XSE V6 is going to be the biggest caveat to the new Accord. However like Sofyan I think you really can't go wrong with either. I 100% agree to what Sofyan at 19:28, with new generation of these really good midsize sedans I hope more will buy Camrys & Accords over another Rav4/Highlander or CR-V/Pilot (I almost can't believe I'm saying that).",0,false,0,,,,,,

THANK YOU. Honestly, speaking as someone who hasn't driven one, Dollar-For-Dollar it seems that even the 2016 Touring gave the buyers more on 4 wheels than the 2016 TLX. I've heard that people claim the drive-quality in the TLX is heads-and-tails above the Accord, but when you have Android Auto/Apple Carplay, the top trim in everything and no compromises, it's tough to say ""Well this $36k Luxury Car with 4Cyl and FWD has an Acura badge on it, ergo it's better"".

The Mid-cycle TLX looks fresh, but I just can't be bothered to be buying a NEW car in 2017/2018 that still uses an infotainment system that's straight out of 2007 and doesn't have driving-assist features standard. Fixing the trunk space makes me really excited for the Accord Touring, and honestly, the MT + Turbo + Honda Sensing is all I wanted in a car and makes the 2.0T VERY attractive for me.

Mr Honda has to be turning in his grave to see the current state of HMC. Without Marc Marquez, they would have nothing in motor sport to talk about. The RC213V is crap, the CBR1000rr is crap, their return to F1 is a royal embarrassment. The current honda offering of vehicles are rubbish! The acura line is really a very poor excuse for a luxury line of vehicles.  I've owned 6 honda vehicles over the years and my 2013 TSX V6 will be the LAST! Toyota a company I hold with great contempt, stands a better chance of getting my money today over honda & that is really a sad sad thought.",1,true,1,,,,,,

There's no way in hell I'd pay more than $25k for an i4. I think the styling is atrocious. The fast back design is disgusting and does not work -- absolutely ruins the look. The front end is horrible, the Charger looking grille is ugly (ugly on the charger too) and the headlights are odd. The rear end is hideous. Those taillights are absolutely disgusting. The rear end is too square and odd looking. I hate it. Those exhaust tips integrated into the bumper are awful and they look crooked. The interior is okay, minus the ignorant push button gear selectors and those ugly GM-looking front seats. I can't stand this new Accord. No V6 sucks. This car will not be quicker than the 6, or as smooth, or refined or fun to drive. I'm so disgusted with Honda and Acura anymore. Their styling is horrific and they're changing everything that used to make me love them both. I hate the Civic and this is just a blown up Civic. The 2018 Camry XSE V6 is sexy as hell and really fun to drive. Plus that 301hp V6 is nice. This is the first time I've loved a Camry and hate an Accord. Honda failed big time on this new one. I still cannot get past the hideous styling. My God Honda, what the fuck is going on with you and Acura??? You make the ugliest vehicles on the market now and your wheels are horrible. That directional spinning look is ugly! This isn't 1989. The 19's on the 16-17 Sport and Touring are beautiful, but you had to ruin that too. So pissed off about this new Accord. You need an all new design team for Honda and Acura and new management. The 2018 Camry XSE V6 is my choice.

Honda V6s were tunable, they are just more expensive to do so..
A J37 Stroked Build is hitting 400HP N/A, Add a Turbo or a S/C and 600HP with stock internals is totally doable... 

J Series is a strong motor, Sadly Turbo engines are just more inline with CAFE Standards and more strict MPG goals.... I for one do not like to have an engine that will eat through my engine oil faster because of a turbo, requiring full synthetic oil all the time with stupid short change intervals.. Turbos also have a far lower reliability record than N/A Engines and Turbos are very expensive to replace in the long run.",2

nowadays a solid surface is aerodynamically superior to have where a vent WOULD have been in a 90s car (in that location), BUT!! they have to think as aesthetic designers ""what SHOULD go there?... we can't just eliminate the vent. it would look too plain with all that negative space"" in other words, they knew NO vent at all would be a superior design from an engineering standpoint, BUT it would look ugly just being plain. So they at least added the appearance we are used to, so that our eyes can digest the body lines. It was a good decision.
