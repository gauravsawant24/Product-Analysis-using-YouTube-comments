# Product-Analysis-using-YouTube-comments
In this project I have used comments on car review videos on YouTube to figure out if it is possible for companies to get insights about customer sentiment towards products by using YouTube comments.

This project was done as a part of a poster presentation show at Stevens Institute of Technology. The poster is also added in the repository. Do check that out.

Regarding the code: The jupyter notebooks are pretty self-explanatory and all the coding steps are well-explained.
