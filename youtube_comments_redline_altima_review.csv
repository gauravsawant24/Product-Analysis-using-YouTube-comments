You have three choices: 1 - auto drive mode, 2 - auto sport drive mode, 3 - manual mode with the paddles. Shifts are quick and responsive in all modes.
the trick in manual mode is to ""milk"" the throttle as you would with a stick shift trans. Its not a DSG! Also, it does take some practice to use the paddles correctly.

Nissan had so many problems with their CVTs they extended the warranty on them to 100,000 miles and 7 years.  I later bought a 2015 3.5 SL and it had several recalls on it.  The piece of crap power steering made noise all of the time and Nissan said its normal.  It made a clicking noise in the front driver‚Äôs side wheel area and the problem was finally found and fixed when an axel was pulled and greased which cost me a couple hundred dollars because Nissan didn‚Äôt fix it under warranty when I complained about it several times.  The final problem with my Nissan is when the piece of crap CVT started making a whining noise at low speed.  The car had 40,000 miles on it.  I brought it to Nissan and they said they can‚Äôt hear the noise and there are no error codes for the CVT.  Needless to say, I just traded the piece of crap Nissan in for a 2018 Honda Accord 2.0T EXL and love the car.  I wanted a V6 but Honda did the turbo right and it is a faster car than my two Nissan V6s.

UgyMHpy52_F8DmKMkTd4AaABAg,Desmond Harvard,4 months ago,1545138707800,"I won't say I hate this trend, but I hate this trend of manufacturers making 4 cyl turbo engines without making an alternative v6 model... I would appreciate if Manufacturers made both. 4 cylinder turbo engines are only good if you lease them because the engine naturally won't last as long. The engine is more stressed meaning it wears and tears quicker.  a v6 doesn't have to try as hard to cruise at 80mph or speed up to 50mph from a light than a 4 cylinder, meaning less strain over time. In the same comparison a v8 doesn't have to try nearly as hard as a v6. This new fad of 4 cylinder turbo just to please the market and crunch numbers for EPA ratings is a disaster. 4 cyl turbo is no good unless you plan on leasing the car and moving on a few years later. No the money you save on gas is not going to be nearly enough to forego maintenance costs. Not only is the engine more stressed but now you have another component yeah, the TURBO to deal with. This is such a cash-grab against the consumer. Most people don't know that if you drive a car hard and park it. You have to let it idle for a few minutes so the oil can cool down, other-wise you damage the turbo because the oil runs super-hot. Common drivers are unaware of this, and so this turbo fad is just costing them more money due to ignorance in terms of taking care of an engine.",0,false,0,,,,,,

Their problems with this transmission are widely known to those of us who read enthusiast magazines or watch the related videos.  I know that they are doing it for fuel economy purposes, but in my opinion, they should add extra gears instead to a well built transmission.  The fact that it's a CVT, not to mention the known reliability issues with this transmission, would cause me to purchase another brand.  Also, as you may know, Nissan achieves the Variable Compression part by changing a pin's location on the connecting rod.  I just wonder if this will cause problems after 100k miles (or less).  I'm sure that Nissan tested it, but that is a lot of movement within the engine -- and how tough can that pin and its associated mechanism be?  I think Honda, Toyota, and the American manufacturers have a better solution.  Nissan needs to watch itts reputation with itts CVT transmissions or their sales may really be affected.",0,false,0,,,,,,

UgzrIyTjek-I1SAWO5N4AaABAg,Julie Harden,5 months ago,1542546711388,"I just leased a 2019 Altima SL Platinum (my 5th Altima, and 7th Nissan overall).  This is my least favorite Altima ever (I've leased a 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2015 previously, with the 2013 being my favorite car ever).
I'll start with the good - 
1.  there are no packages on the SL model; it's all included.  The technology package, plus a few extra features. 
2.  compact disc functionality is gone.  
3.  Navigation automatically displays what street you're on, if you choose that display (I like to leave the display on which direction my car is going, so I also get street display).


And the bad (I get that most people will disagree with me; these are just preferences). 
1.  Beige leather interior is no longer offered. I settled for the light gray interior, and honestly, it looks like a rental car.  The off-color stitching looks cheap (see 7:46), the dashboard material looks cheap - like something you would get in a rental car.  The interior is very dark, and I really, really loved the black exterior, with the beige leather interior - I thought it looks really classy, and light. Also, there is way more nooks and crannies all over the dash, making it a pain to clean.
2.  The seats are smaller.  Much smaller - maybe 2 inches narrower, and at least an inch less depth.  Also, the seat doesn't go down as far as it used to.  I'm only 5'4"" and my head is about 5 inches from the roof.  I feel like I'm sitting on a folding chair; no longer surrounded by those soft, comfy seats of the 2013 and 2015 models. 
3.  the steering wheel is smaller, which feels weird when turning, or pulling into a parking space, or pulling out of a parking space.  Also, when I rest my elbow on the door, my fingers barely touch the steering wheel.   
    Also note at 8:14 the new steering wheel controls - they are all flat, so it makes if difficult to turn the volume up/down, or to dismiss notifications, or to to skip songs, etc. without taking your eyes off the road.   I have to look down every time.  In the 2013 and 2015 models, there was a lever that you could feel for without taking your eyes off the road.  I really miss that.  Same goes for cruise control - all the buttons are flat. 
4.  Less visibility all around.  One of the first things I noticed as I drove the car off the lot was less visibility through the windows.  Less window space compared to the 2013 and 2015 models .  The back window seems shorter.  When looking over your right shoulder to see if there is a car out the back passenger side window - that is now a bigger blind spot.  But, I think the worst visibility issue is the front window - there is now a camera on the opposite side of the rearview mirror (you can this for a second at 5:57 - see how much window space that camera takes up?  Decreases visibility when you look out the front window to your right). 
5.  too much clutter on the view screen.  You can see what I'm talking about at 6:58. This is the display I use as well.   Note, the time is displayed here - and it's also displayed on the floating screen to your left.  Two time displays!  It drives me nuts. 
6.  Entertainment system presets - if you want to change the channel, you have to use the touchscreen - which means you have to look at the touch screen every time you want to change the channel - you can't feel for the buttons.  This means you have to take your eyes of the road every time.  I don't think they thought this through. 
7.  The Camera - might be the most disappointing change.  Look at the video at 9:08 - that is the default view.  you can press the ""camera"" button 2 more times to get the standard, full screen view that you get in the 2013 and 2015 models - but you have to press the button twice EVERY TIME YOU PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE.  Every time.  I've had this car for 17 days  and I've already stopped looking at the camera when I back up.  
8 At 9:48 you can see the settings - this is where you need to go to turn off data collection.  It's defaulted to ""on"" and and various data is sent to Nissan.  I've turned this off once already, and noticed it was back on today.  
9.  the heated seats don't seem to get as warm as in previous models.  Heated steering wheel seems to get a little warmer than previous models. 
10.  Why would you put an electronic parking break lever on the consul?  Who uses it that much, that it needs to take up prime real estate?


I wish Nissan conducted Usability with loyal customers, or even a focus group, or feedback session.  I'm not sure they thought this one through.  I don't know.  I have a feeling I will be in the minority with this.   Also - I hate those LED headlights.  They are blinding. 


Thanks for letting me vent.  I love Nissan, and I am just really, really disappointed.  I should have bought my 2013 Altima 2.5 SL.  It was the perfect car.",99,true,21,,,,,,

You don't seem to grasp the concept of the 'all-around' camera featured in the platinum model which is far superior to the single only view camera on the lower trim models.  You can now see everything around you, and can also see in front of you when you are parking.  No need to toggle the camera trying to get a single view.  Navigation always displayed what street you are on.  Not many people like beige interior because it gets dirty quickly.  If beige was a deal breaker, why did you lease the car?  Your head is FIVE inches from the roof...how much more headroom do you need?  The entire vehicle is modeled from the current Maxima, which explains the new D-shaped steering wheel.  It is pretty easy to feel the button controls on the steering wheel without looking at them.  You can change station presets with the steering wheel controls as well as the touchscreen.  #5...you can change the center display to whatever view you want...Audio, Navi, Fuel, etc.  You don't have to leave it on the 'Home' screen.  If you don't like all that 'clutter' then switch to the Navi view which only shows the compass if that is what you want.  You can also scroll some of the screens up and down to get more or less content on the screen.  You can even turn off the center display.  #10...where else do you want the electric parking brake switch?  Next to the shift lever is where people expect it to be.  The only valid complaint is maybe the size of the seats.  Your other complaints seem petty because you don't understand the features in the car.  The new Altima now has almost all of the features of the Maxima, but for $10K less.  I owned a 2015 Altima SL and yes, it was a great vehicle.  I upgraded to a Maxima for the features that the 2015 Altima lacked.  The 2013-2015 Altima stereo was full of bugs with a slow responding touch screen.  Thankfully the new Altima is more consistent with the stereo in the Maxima/Murano.  My lease is up on the Maxima and I am looking forward to going back to the Altima for the better gas mileage while retaining almost all of the features that were in the Maxima.",0

What I mean by this is....they developed a more costly and complicated engine that gets 2 more mpg than the Honda turbo engine however it‚Äôs 4 less hp. So the engine makes less power and get 2 more mpg. Yes that makes sense, the weaker engine often get slightly better mpg....however I don‚Äôt see the benefit of developing this engine to only get 2 more mpg. Not to mention the Altima is the heavier car so I don‚Äôt see it out performing the Accord. It also doesn‚Äôt have a nice piano roof like the Camry. It‚Äôs all just not worth the investment. No one gives a crap about that engine. We won‚Äôt notice that difference over the mpg of an accord. Now, because of that investment they cut cost in other area. They don‚Äôt offer any LED interior lights, no pretty LED exterior lights and they put soft touch materials in the front of the car and hard plastics for the rear cabin. Ummmm....these are the things that buyers see everyday. How about just get a regular old 2.0L turbo without the fancy parts to switch compression(which is actually just more parts to break) and then dress the car up a bit with some nicer materials and some nice lighting.

From chassis assembly to interior bolt on, Toyota studied it and made sure good old Toyota plants in America can't screw it up. Nissan is learning the hard way that Americans have the worst work ethic. That's a fact. Nissan was great, when they were built in japan.

I'm not denying they have held up for you but the vast majority of Lexus Vehicles outlast the German big 3 today and that's not a matter of opinion it's simply fact. It's one reason people who make the switch or have stuck with Lexus pick them over German cars. They are more dependable period. I get where you're coming with the Nokia and IPhone X comparison but that's a bit of an overexaggeration. Lexus isn't that level far behind in tech. In more recent times they have stepped it up in terms of features, interior design and driving dynamics. You can't seriously look at something like the new LS & LC500 and tell me those cars are complete garbage. The GS & IS handle similarly to their German rivals. I would continue this back and forth but see that it's a waste of time since you've been blinded by only German cars. Yes, they make some very nice cars but with the exception of ""Porsche"" reliability isn't something German cars are known for anymore, they're often ridiculed for their terrible reliability along with their over the top expenses to fix (even for the simpler stuff).",5

UgyQcTV1BmJZdUQAWkx4AaABAg,Paul A,5 months ago,1542546719388,"Great video. Really shows the inside and out of this car.  However, the buyers that look for cars like this, don‚Äôt care about the little things.  We look for them as enthusiasts but half the buyers don‚Äôt even know what compression ratio is they just want good gas mileage.  I love the key fob on Nissan/Infiniti, they are suppose to fit in your pocket or bag where its never seen so i think people could careless about them.  And sense these are new cars, the transmissions haven‚Äôt figured out shift or rev points yet so that might be why the throttle response is weird, but like it was stated, if you want a sportier car look at Infiniti.  What I would about keep in mind is, things that were ‚Äúleft out‚Äù are sometimes not included on purpose to keep economy and premium separate.  I know that if I buy an Infiniti and it came with the same engine, as a Nissan, why should I spend 50k when the car for 30k has everything. Heated and cooled seats should come standard buuut I understand how that can be considered premium like auto windows is a premium feature.  Keep in mind Mazda doesn‚Äôt have a premium brand so they can add things because they don‚Äôt have a premium brand to worry about, that is why they have LED headlights and interior light and heated and cooled seats.

Every time I went to the dealer, there were several people there with bad nissan CVT transmssions that were failing well beyond 50k. Nissan acknoweldged this, but instead of making a recall, they only offered a 100k warrenty on engine and transmission.

First off that tablet screen style was done by Mazda years ago, the very first in this category of vehicles.  Not Ford, Chevrolet,  Toyota,  Honda,  Kia, Hyundai.  Then the Kia Stinger was unveiled way back in 2017 LONG before the Honda Accord.  If not for that Kia Stinger the Accord wouldn't look the way it does. If you think for a second that the Accord isn't 100% inspired from the KIA STINGER,  then you're in the wrong business of being a automobile reviewer and not giving the people honesty. So if you want to say copying from Mazda, fine, but don't mislead people like Honda is still leading the way. Honda is now following in the paths of Kia and Hyundai.

UgzInSEycD43gZxe0MZ4AaABAg,Stephen Hendricks,6 months ago,1539868352134,"Nice exterior styling. That's subjective, of course, but given its simplicity, I'd put it near the the Mazda6 and Passat in exterior looks. Better than the Accord (that appears to have been designed by a committee) and the Camry (that looks like the descendant of a 1930's Flash Gordon spaceship.) Have to say though that I'm not a fan of the my-grill-is-bigger-than-yours styling trend. Though the Altima is playing that game, it can't compare to the Camry and especially the (hideous) bass mouth Avalon. 

Otherwise, the Altima strikes me as competent but hardly inspiring. Those of us who don't like CVT's are unlikely to be mollified by ""simulated"" gears. On the other hand, have to give props to Nissan for not adding insult to injury by adding ""simulated"" paddle shifters. Would have been amusing to be a fly on the wall when the marketing folks were told that the BIG NEWS this year would be ""the world's first variable compression engine in a mainstream sedan."" I suspect the meeting was held on a ground floor to prevent injuries when the participants dived out of the windows. AWD might have been a feature to tout. Of the competitors only Subaru and the dying Ford Fusion offer it. But inexplicably Nissan limits its availability to the base engine. How does that make ANY sense? ""Check out our AWD! Oh, you wanted the better engine? Sorry.""

The interior is OK but hardly distinctive. A button on the steering wheel to turn off/on the complete set of safety features? Huh? Who's going to use it on a regular basis? Otherwise, the only standout feature in the interior is the seats. Badly configured and uncomfortable seats can be a deal breaker but the competition offers perfectly acceptable seats. Do Americans really purchase a car solely because the Altima's seats treat their asses especially well? (Don't answer that.) Other aspects of the interior are no more inspiring. Just one minor cost cutting shortcoming after another. No wireless charging. Cheap plastic in the rear seats, much like the Camry. Plastic wood trim that looks more like plastic than wood. Perforated front seats that do NOT include ventilation?  A complex set of trim levels that mix and match features. Would hate to be the salesperson who has to explain them.

Bottom line? Not as engaging as the Honda or the Mazda6. Same as far as a premium interior is concerned. Not as much room as the Passat or the Honda. Chock full of minor cost cutting. Lots of ""you can't get that with this"" trim levels. All in all an also ran.",0,false,0,,,,,,

Anyway, I'm not sold on the complexity of the VC operation, as reducing cylinder ""squish"" during high boost will increase detonation propensity, requiring further enrichment and/or lower compression vs. an optimized fixed compression engine. Dynamic compression can be varied with variable cam timing and lift without changing the combustion chamber burn characteristics.

Really, even with the 7 speed, you need to run an aftermarket transmission and oil cooler setup if you want it to not self destruct if you want to abuse it.  Level 10 offers built versions for $5k (great if you're going forced induction).      CVT = JOKE.

So, If it makes anyone feel better:   Every single oil change survey from the dealership, I let nissan know how I feel on this topic, and over the past 5 years of 370z ownership, not a single response from Nissan of America or anyone.  So, Nissan will continue to crap out cvt garbage as long as they have sub prime financing available (this IS the dirty secret that Nissan won't discuss, but talk to any finance manager off the record;  Altimas are the perfect shitbox for people with bad credit and have some of the HIGHEST depreciation among ordinary sedans in it's class for this very reason; which explains why we all see losers/jerks driving them for the most part, yes, anecdotal evidence but it's what I've witnessed / just like how prius drivers tend to be either helpless victim thinkers OR narcisists wanting to ""fit in.""",0

The only difference between SL and Platinum are 360 degree camera, 2 person memory seats, and standard interior ambient lighting. The price speaks for the car. Theres a less than $2K difference between the Platinum and the SL I believe. I do think however, that this should change and the platinum should be better substantially, even if it makes the car a little less affordable. My main problem with the Altima is that it still doesn't use a lot of simple luxuries that a lot of other companies have adopted and have been using for quite a while. I wish they'd put a sensor behind the door handle instead of requiring the button to get inside. I wish they had full LEDs (including interior) available on at least the SL trim... ventilated seats while not yet standard across the class , still could've probably made it unto the third best selling sedan in the U.S. and finally the lack of the panoramic roof top is most upsetting, as this alone would have been a massive plus for this car's overall look. It's definitely the best looking sedan from japan on the outside... but mazda spanks them as well as everybody else on the interior and Toyota beats it in sportiness. AWD and the appearance of the sedan are literally the ONLY things that Nissan has over everybody else... will that be enough? 2019 sales numbers will see",7

Based off of what this trim offers, I don't see much of a reason for Nissan wanting to add this trim. It would make more sense to just get rid of the SL trim and call it platinum or just put these little bit of extra features on the SL trim and call it a day. SL was always the highest since the second generation Altima. Anybody who knows cars sees an SL and knows that's the top one you can get. Replacing it with platinum sounds better, but I dont think they needed a whole new trim to go above it when all this one adds is the wood tone across the dash and 2 person memory driver seats. They didn't even change anything. Usually each trim offers 4 or more upgrades from the one before it but NissanUSA.com says all this adds are 19"" wheels which are available on the SR and if it's anything like previous nissan vehicles, they're optional for other trims. They also made interior accent lighting standard. But that too is optional on lower trims. So are people going to spend $3K more for 1 extra feature and 1 interior ""upgrade""?",1

They're just protecting the Maxima as best they can because they pretty much made the exact same car with the Altima. In 2018 the Maxima had a purpose but for 2019 all that serious tech that the Altima offers is even more expansive than the outgoing Maxima so right now the ONLY reason to buy a Maxima is for the speed. I had my eyes on a Platinum trim Maxima for over half a hear now, but I can't justify paying 45K (my platinum with options) when I can get an Altima with just as much tech and then some, with a better looking exterior (in my opinion) and AWD for $10K less.

But it's not on another world of difference imo. They're both zero gravity seats. One car just has diamond quilted leather for style points. The Maxima's tech falls behind to the new Altima however, which is why if tech is more important to someone than 50 horses, I couldn't recommend the Maxima to a buyer.



Just to reiterate/clarify I think the Maxima still has the best overall interior and probably the best in its class against competitors as well, and there's plenty of good things on the clipboard when you pull up that thing's specifications. All I would argue is that this new Altima only makes it harder for a Nissan fan to pick which sedan they want. Maxima still lacks very necessary AWD and Altima's only drawback is not looking as pretty and expensive on the inside. But I think this new design language on the Altima looks better than the Maxima and that's coming from the biggest Maxima fanboy ever",1

Actually, I'm waiting for 2019 Rav 4 to make my conclusion. But I won't trade my Altima for the new 2019 Altima. Very disappointed. Also, this Altima exterior looks like Maxima. Interior very bad.

The interior, while not amazing, is not the worst in its class by any means and I was not disappointed at all by what I was seeing. I look forward to getting the keys for one... my dealership is taking their sweet time getting ahold of any. Evidently they just dropped off one Altima SR which is not even close to what I want.

That said, the floating roof is executed terribly and the misaligned handles are ugly.  The new grill looks great, but most people will see the car from the rear or side on the freeway Nissan.

My experience with Nissan has been that they're comfortable and have nicer materials than Toyota, but the build quality is just crap compared to Honda or Toyota.  Parts falling apart in just a few years, insulation poking out, dials making grinding noises....I hope they have seriously worked to address that or it's lipstick on a pig. 

I kind of wish Nissan would trim down their line and focus on quality and R&D instead of having the now redundant Maxima and every size ugly CUV under the sun.  Toyota and Honda are going to overtake them on autonomy soon despite getting in the game much later.  Nissan had the vision, they were talking EVs and autonomy before it was cool, but they made too many poor business decisions to benefit from it.  That's unfortunate, I wanted them to do better than they have.",23,true,3,,,,,,

But shouldn't Nissan put the needed trans cooler on the car, since it sells in all 50 states?  It seems to me that if it was just a trans cooler issue, they would spend the money and do this, rather than risk their reputation everywhere.  It seems that there is more to it than that, as Nissan would have done that if it were so simple.  I don't think that they're that stupid.",0

Drove it hard, went years without changing the oil or doing regular maintenance. I put some head gasket fix and it run like brand new. My next Nissan/Infiniti is my first 2004 G35x. 192k and no problems but regular maintenance. Oil comes out squeaky clean every 3k miles and runs stronger than when I got it. Mostly due to my mods it pulls hard but it still drives like a new car. And my current 16 Q50 3.0t only has 43k. It has given me no problems only fun. Ecutek tune, full race downpipes and muffler delete. It sounds amazing and exotic. I love putting 5.0s in my rear view mirror! All in my Japanese reliable luxury sedan :) Ps. I take care of my Infinitis more because they're Infinitis but I still drive them like hell. Definitely not skipping oil changes or car washes",0

I have a 13 Rogue with 180k on it and no tranny issues and moved to Florida 2yrs ago. Sooooo yeah it gets sluggish when hot or the fluid needs changing. I did mine for the first time last wkend. Before anyone flips their shit, cvt's you can do that because they dont have clutch packs. It shifts better now and I will change it 3 more times before the end of the year to get it as close to clean then do it yearly after. Anyhow I will not buy another just because the lag so bad and you can not, I repeat can not put your foot on the gas and go in any remote way. My Rogue blows for passing and the 170hp doesnt help any. Next vehicle will have either a stick (wtf is that these days) or a regular automatic.  No cvt bullshit.",0
